import SwiftUI

/// One place that decides what the design system renders text in.
///
/// Every component used to reach for `.font(.subheadline)` directly, which was
/// not wrong — it is the platform UI font, and that is the intent — but it left
/// the decision spread across ninety-odd call sites with nothing naming it. The
/// same choice was being made three times over: web asked for `"Readex Pro",
/// sans-serif` and, because nothing has ever loaded Readex Pro, rendered generic
/// sans-serif; Android took Roboto by default; this package took SF Pro. Three
/// platforms, three fonts, no decision recorded anywhere.
///
/// System-first is now deliberate. These wrappers resolve to the platform's own
/// UI font and keep Dynamic Type intact, because `Font.system(_:)` scales with
/// the reader's text-size setting exactly as the bare styles did.
///
/// Nothing here has ever bundled a font file, which is why an App Clip can drop
/// the brand font without the design system noticing.
///
/// To render a brand font instead, this is the only file that changes:
///
/// ```swift
/// public static var brandFamily: String?   // e.g. "Readex Pro", once bundled
///
/// public static func font(_ style: Font.TextStyle) -> Font {
///     guard let family = brandFamily else { return .system(style) }
///     // relativeTo keeps Dynamic Type working; size is the style's own.
///     return .custom(family, size: pointSize(for: style), relativeTo: style)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A brand font also needs its metrics measured against the system font, or the
/// same point size renders visibly different: run
/// `node scripts/measure-font-metrics.mjs <brand> <fallback>` and apply the
/// scale it reports. Guessing that ratio is how text ends up subtly wrong on
/// every screen at once.
public enum KozmosTypography {
    /// The platform UI font at a Dynamic Type style.
    public static func font(_ style: Font.TextStyle) -> Font {
        .system(style)
    }

    public static var body: Font { font(.body) }
