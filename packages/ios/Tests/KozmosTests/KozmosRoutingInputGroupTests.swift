/// content (16 in; React's CSS border adds 1 more there and takes 2 from the
/// fields' width, which a SwiftUI overlay does not): a 14 start ring 12 down
/// in theme/600, a 2 × 36 connector in the border role 8 below it, 40-high
/// fields 12 apart and 28 in, washed black at 5 %, and a 40 swap 24 down, 12
/// from the fields, in the secondary fill. Until 2026-09-22 the fields were
/// washed in foreground/900 at 5 %, which showed on neither theme, the swap was
/// a 40 circle 28 down, and the rail theme/500 over foreground/300.
