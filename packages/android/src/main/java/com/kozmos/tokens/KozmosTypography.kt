/**
 * One place that decides what the design system renders text in.
 *
 * Nothing here set a font family before, so every component inherited whatever
 * Material handed it - Roboto on most devices. That was the right answer by
 * accident rather than by decision, and the same decision was being made three
 * times over: web asked for `"Readex Pro", sans-serif` and, because nothing has
 * ever loaded Readex Pro, rendered generic sans-serif; iOS rendered SF Pro;
 * this package rendered Roboto. Three platforms, three fonts, nothing recording
 * the choice.
 *
 * System-first is now deliberate. [family] is the platform's own UI font, so
 * this changes nothing today - which is the point. It gives the decision an
 * address.
 *
 * To render a brand font instead, this is the only file that changes:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val family: FontFamily = FontFamily(Font(R.font.readex_pro))
 * ```
 *
 * A brand font also needs its metrics measured against the system font, or the
 * same sp value renders visibly different: run
 * `node scripts/measure-font-metrics.mjs <brand> <fallback>` and apply the scale
 * it reports. Guessing that ratio is how text ends up subtly wrong on every
 * screen at once.
