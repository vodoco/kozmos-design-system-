/**
 * Layout of the spinner, mirroring the React `Spinner.size`.
 *
 * The `Spinner/size` scale (small, medium, large, xlarge): 16, 24, 32 and 48,
 * as React's classes and the Figma variables draw them. The natives have no
 * generated token for these — the four live as Figma component variables — so
 * the scale is written here and on SwiftUI until they reach `packages/tokens`.
 *
 * The doc sits above the declaration, not inside the body: the variant-parity
 * check splits an enum body on commas to read its entries, and a comment
 * holding one took Spinner's whole axis with it.

/**
 * Indeterminate loading: the system's arc, turning.
 *
 * Before 2026-09-22 this was material3's `CircularProgressIndicator` at its own
 * default size, while React drew lucide's arc, iOS drew a `ProgressView` tinted
 * a hard-coded blue and Figma drew an ellipse with a dash pattern. Four
 * drawings, no two alike — and material3 1.1.2's indeterminate indicator is the
 * one Paparazzi cannot render against animation-core 1.6.0, so no golden has
 * ever shown one.
 *
 * This is the one drawing: three quarters of a circle from the top, round caps,
 * stroke 2 in the icons' own 24 box so the weight scales with the mark. It
 * rests when the system's animations are off; the description still says what
 * is happening.
