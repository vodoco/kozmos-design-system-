/**
 * A row of small facts about one thing, each a label and a value.
 *
 * Measured from the SDK's POI detail card (`HbFSXhCPxKUy2fWa5x9TKO`, node
 * `241:4772`, 2026-09-14): a 64-tall strip of bordered tiles carrying travel
 * time, distance, rating, price band, wheelchair access, crowd level and access
 * restriction. The scan found the strip on four surfaces and its tiles on more
 * — the rating tile alone on four, the accessibility glyph 1,213 times across
 * seven.
 *
 * It is a description list, because that is what it is: every tile pairs a
 * label with a value. A tile may hide its label visually — a price band reads
 * "$$$$" and a rating reads "4.5" — but the label is always in the accessible
 * name, so the strip does not become a row of unexplained glyphs to a screen
 * reader.
 *
 * Domain-neutral by design (§5.5): it knows nothing about POIs, only about
 * facts. What each tile means is the caller's business.
