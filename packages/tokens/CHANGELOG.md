### Minor Changes

- 42fbe70: Emotion text reads on every neutral surface. `Semantics.Emotion.*.Text` was
  measured on white alone, and four of six failed 4.5:1 on the greys a panel,
  card or sheet paints (background/50 and /100): success and alert move from 800
  to 900, informative from 700 to 800, danger from 600 to 700; themed and neutral
  already passed. The contrast contract now holds every emotion's text on
  background/0, /50 and /100 in both themes.

  React draws status text and glyphs with the new Tailwind `*-text` roles
  (`text-success-text`, `text-warning-text`, `text-info-text`,
  `text-destructive-text`), which read those tokens; `success`, `warning`, `info`
  and `destructive` stay the fills, edges and rings they were.
