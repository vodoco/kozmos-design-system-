/**
 * Write a generated JSON file the way lint-staged would commit it.
 *
 * The generators wrote JSON.stringify's output and left the pre-commit hook to
 * prettify it, so a checked-in file never matched what its generator wrote:
 * every regeneration reflowed thousands of lines of short arrays before the
 * real change could be seen — 3,331 lines for the library manifest on
 * 2026-09-13, of which 24 mappings and 22 tokens were the change. Formatting
 * here, with the repository's own Prettier configuration, makes a regeneration
 * a content-only diff, and lets a check compare the checked-in file with what
 * the generator produces.
 *
 * `volatileKeys` finishes that job for the files carrying a `generatedAt`. A
 * timestamp that moves on every run makes the diff meaningless again — the
 * reader cannot tell a regeneration from a change — so when the only
 * difference from the file on disk is in those keys, the file is left alone.
 * The timestamp then answers "when did this content last change", which is the
 * question someone reading it actually has.
