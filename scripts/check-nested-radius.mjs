/**
 * Concentric corner radii: does each rounded shape hug the rounded shape inside
 * it?
 *
 * Two rounded rectangles nested one inside the other look right only when
 *
 *     R_outer = R_inner + padding
 *
 * That is not a heuristic. It is the only value that holds the gap between the
 * two curves constant all the way around the corner; at any other value the gap
 * pinches or flares exactly where the eye is most sensitive to it. The failure
 * reads as "uneven roundness" long before anyone can name the cause.
 *
 * A second rule bounds the first: a radius above `min(width, height) / 2`
 * cannot render, because opposite corners would overlap. Figma and CSS both
 * clamp silently, so a token above the cap is a number that lies about what it
 * draws. The `pill: 9999` role is that clamp used deliberately — a sentinel
 * meaning "as round as this box allows".
 *
 * This reads the published Figma file rather than the plugin source, because
 * the relationship is geometric: it needs the rendered box of both shapes and
 * the space between them, and none of that exists in the builder's arguments.
 *
 * When a flagged property is bound to a variable the report says so, because a
 * bound property renders the variable's value and ignores whatever the painter
 * wrote. The fix is then in the variable's definition, and reading the painter
 * will only say the number is already right.
 *
 * Reported, not enforced. Some pairs below are deliberate, and deciding which
 * is a design call — see docs/nested-radius.md. Pass --strict to fail on
 * violations once the backlog is closed.
