/**
 * Cross-platform variant parity report.
 *
 * `check-completion.ts` proves that a file exists. This script looks inside the
 * files and compares the variant surface each platform actually exposes:
 *
 *   React    cva `variants: { axis: { value } }` blocks and union-typed props
 *   SwiftUI  `public enum Kozmos<Component><Axis> { case value }`
 *   Compose  `enum class Kozmos<Component><Axis> { Value }`
 *   Figma    `expectedVariantAxesForComponentSetName` in the importer plugin
 *
 * React is treated as the reference surface because it is the only platform at
 * 97/97 with stories and tests. A gap therefore means "this axis or value is in
 * React but the other platform cannot express it".
 *
 * Values are compared case-insensitively with separators stripped, so
 * `step-free`, `stepFree`, and `StepFree` are the same value.
