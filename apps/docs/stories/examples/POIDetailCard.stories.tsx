 * Source: POI Details Card Revamp, `HbFSXhCPxKUy2fWa5x9TKO`, node `241:4772`
 * (375×3183, 886 nodes), read over the Figma REST API on 2026-09-14.
 *
 * The rule this example is built under (`docs/ds-handoff.md` §11): only what
 * `@kozmos/react` exports, its tokens and its roles. No hand-rolled markup
 * standing in for a missing component, no raw hex, no one-off class that
 * quietly reinvents a part — a workaround would destroy the evidence this
 * example exists to collect.
 *
 * So where the design system cannot express a part, this file says so in an
 * `Alert` and renders nothing in its place. Those holes are the finding.
 * Every deviation is listed in `docs/poi-detail-card-gaps-2026-09-14.md`.
