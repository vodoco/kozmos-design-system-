 * Pointr's mapping team holds the level the customer keeps editing, told their changes may be

 * likely to see, not a splash passed through on the way to review.
 *
 * The AI-Mapping section is the level's **update timeline**: every arrival — floor-plan upload,
 * GeoJSON push, restore — is a version; the status card is the newest version's live state.
