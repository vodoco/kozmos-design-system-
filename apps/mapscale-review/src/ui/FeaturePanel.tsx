/**
 * The POI properties panel (§19) — what a selected feature *is*, and now what it can be *made* to
 * be.
 *
 * **Floating over the map's right edge, not a third column** (Olcay, 2026-08-12: *"floating panel
 * on the map's right, don't resize map but center — offset the key element on the map"*). The map
 * keeps its width and the *camera* makes room: `focusPadRight` frames the feature in the part of
 * the map the panel doesn't cover.
 *
 * **Two modes, deliberately modelled on two different real screens** (Olcay, 2026-08-12, with the
 * dashboard's *Editing Map Content* panel and the SDK's POI-card contract attached — *"all
 * properties should be editable… maybe we can align with that a little using our design system"*):
 *
 * - **Reading is the SDK's POI card.** That card derives its sections from `properties` — 23
 *   sections out of 60 properties in the published contract — so this one does too: an array or
 *   enum becomes a titled chip group, a boolean becomes a chip only when it is *true*, a hyperlink
 *   becomes an action, and `description` gets the paragraph under the title. Nothing here is a
 *   hand-written list of fields; add `cuisines` in edit mode and a **Cuisines** section appears,
 *   for the same reason it appears on the real card.
 * - **Editing is the dashboard's *Editing Map Content*.** FID read-only with a copy button, the
 *   type selector, a required Name, **Featured**, then *+ Add additional field* with its
 *   **Suggested / Others** split and the value type printed beside each row — and every field
 *   removable by its own bin. Controls are chosen by the taxonomy's own `inputType`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The identifiers are never editable.** `fid`/`bid`/`sid`/`lvl` say *which feature this is and
 * where it lives*; a text box around them offers to re-parent a feature into another building,
 * which is not an edit. The real panel agrees — its FID field is read-only with a copy button, and
 * that is exactly what is built here.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Two DS components that look right and are not**, worth knowing before reaching for them:
 * `POICard` is the *consumer wayfinding* card (hero image, `text-xl` heading, action footer) and
 * `Badge` is touch-sized at `h-11`. Both are scaled for the end-user SDK app, not a 340px dashboard
 * inspector. The DS has no dense property-list component, so the rows are the app's own, built from
 * DS type and tokens.
