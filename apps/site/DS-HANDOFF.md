# Design-system fixes the website needs — a handoff

**For:** the agent that changes Kozmos itself (`packages/`).
**From:** the Kozmos website, `apps/site` on the local branch `claude/kozmos-site`
(worktree `/Volumes/4TB Depo/development/K/kozmos-design-system-site`).
**Written:** 2026-09-22, after a design critique of the site; revised the same
day after an audit of the site, its copy and its tests. Every number below was
measured on the site's production build.

The site is built from Kozmos components and tokens only. Where Kozmos fell
short, the site did not work around it: the gap is recorded in
[`GAPS.md`](./GAPS.md) (GAP-01 to GAP-53, with the evidence), and the site
either composed an honest stand-in from Kozmos parts or left the defect
visible. This document turns those gaps into work for `packages/`, in
priority order, with the file and line, the change, and the site check that
proves it.

**Paths:** a bare path such as `Card/Card.tsx:38` is under
`packages/react/src/components/`; `styles/…` is under `packages/react/src/`.
Anything else is given from the repository root. Line numbers are those of
`f30c0f9`.

## Ground rules

- **Change `packages/`, not the site.** The site's own fixes are done.
- **Where:** the packages the site uses are those of the component branch
  `claude/pointr-browse-repairs` (the site is based on it at `f30c0f9`; the
  packages are unchanged since). Work in your own worktree of that branch, or
  wherever its owner says; the site rebases afterwards (its README,
  "Keeping up with the component branch").
- **Parity:** a part that exists in SwiftUI, Compose or Figma changes there
  too, as `docs/ds-handoff.md` and `pnpm components:contract:check` require.
- **CI:** everything the workflow runs must stay green — the main checks are
  on the site at `/get-started#checks` (`pnpm lint && pnpm build && pnpm
test`, the contract, token, class, install, Figma, browser, Storybook, iOS
  and Android checks).
- **Proof on the site:** each fix below names the site check it flips. The
  site pins today's defects on purpose (`tests/site.spec.ts`: the
  "design-system gaps, measured" tests, the `knownViolations` table, one
  `test.fail`), so a fix makes that check fail. Then flip it — change the
  expectation to the fixed one, or delete the entry — and set the gap to
  _fixed_ in `GAPS.md`.

To run the site against your packages:

```sh
cd "/Volumes/4TB Depo/development/K/kozmos-design-system-site"
pnpm install
pnpm turbo run build --filter=@kozmos/site^...     # rebuild the Kozmos packages
pnpm --filter @kozmos/site build
pnpm --filter @kozmos/site test:e2e                 # Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
```

## P0 — broken for people using it

### GAP-38 · The map sheet's handle is 4 px tall and its grip invisible

- **Where:** `packages/react/src/styles/owned-components.css`, lines 156, 157
  and 166:
  `height: var(--primitives-layout-spacing-200)`,
  `padding-top: var(--primitives-layout-spacing-75)`,
  `width: var(--primitives-layout-sizing-500)`.
- **Why it breaks:** layout tokens are unitless (`16`, `6`, `40`); a unitless
  number is not a length, so the browser drops all three declarations. The
  handle (`role="slider"`, "Panel height") measures 388 × 4 px and its grip
  0 × 4 px, in every engine. These are the only three such declarations in
  the owned stylesheets (checked with a grep over `src/styles/*.css`).
- **Change:** `calc(var(--primitives-layout-spacing-200) * 1px)` and so on —
  the conversion the owned blur and slide rules already use. Give the handle
  a 44 px hit area while you are there (GAP-43).
- **Proof:** the site's test "GAP-38: the map sheet's handle is 4px tall and
  its grip has no width" fails; change it to expect a height of 16 (the
  padding is inside the border box; 44 with the hit area) and a grip width
  of 40.
- **Guard:** add a check to the package that no owned rule uses a
  `--primitives-layout-*` token without `calc(… * 1px)`.

### GAP-40 · Map overlays draw over the sticky header

- **Where:** `MapOverlay/MapOverlay.tsx:66` (`z-50`),
  `styles/owned-navbar.css:5` (`sticky top-0 z-50`), and
  `MapView/MapView.tsx:19`, whose root creates no stacking context.
- **Why it breaks:** equal z-index, and the map comes later in the document,
  so its overlays paint over the header as the page scrolls. Seen on the
  site's hero scene, the MapOverlay reference page and the kiosk example;
  `AdaptiveMapShell` is safe because its root is `isolate`.
- **Change:** `isolate` on `MapView`'s root. Then give the layers an order
  in the tokens (`--primitives-layer-*`) in which a page's sticky
  navigation sits above a map's own overlays.
- **Proof:** "GAP-40: MapView does not isolate its overlays" fails; flip it
  to expect `isolate`. The site's own `isolation: isolate` on its frames can
  then go (`src/styles/site.css`, the comments name GAP-40).

## P1 — visible on the site's first screens, or failing WCAG AA

### GAP-52 · The provider's preflight zeroes a caller's border

- **Where:** `packages/react/postcss/scoped-css.cjs:56`. `compilerDefaults` is
  true for any rule whose selector is `*, ::before, ::after`, meant for
  Tailwind's `--tw-*` initialiser. The preflight's
  `border: 0 solid; box-sizing: border-box` rule has the same selector, so it
  skips the `:where()` of lines 65–74 and keeps `:scope`'s (0,1,0) (line 76).
  Scoped, it then beats any caller class of equal specificity.
- **Change:** decide by the declarations, not the selector: a rule is the
  initialiser only if all it declares is `--tw-*` custom properties. The
  border reset then weighs nothing, as the plugin's own comment intends.
- **Proof:** "GAP-52: the provider's preflight zeroes a caller's border on
  its own box" measures the same rule inside and outside the provider
  (0px and 1px today); flip it to expect 1px in both. The site's
  `Separator` hairlines and `Surface` specimens can stay: they are the
  intended parts, not workarounds.

### GAP-45 · Brand variant 1's dark 600 fails contrast

- **Where:** `packages/tokens/src/tokens-dark.json:519`, the theme variant 1
  ramp's `600`: `#6258F3` (Figma variable `VariableID:1440:2442`).
- **Why it breaks:** 4.20:1 on the dark page's `background-0`, both as text
  (`text-primary`) and as a fill under black ink (a selected Chip, a default
  Button), once a product re-points the theme to variant 1 — which is what
  the variants are for. The default ramp's dark 600 is 6.17:1, variant 2's
  4.99:1; the light theme passes everywhere.
- **Change:** a lighter dark 600 for variant 1 (the variant's own dark 700,
  `#867EF6`, reads 6.33:1), in the tokens and in Figma. Then add each
  variant's "primary action" and "brand tint surface / primary text" pairs
  to `packages/tokens/src/contrast-contract.json`, so every ramp a product
  may choose is measured.
- **Proof:** "GAP-45: the first brand variant's 600 reads 4.20:1 on the dark
  page" fails; flip it to the new ratio. The `knownViolations` entry for
  `/components/theme-provider` (`theme: "dark"`) reports "no longer occurs";
  delete it.

### GAP-31 · Emotion text passes on white only

- **Where:** two paths carry the same two values. The semantic text roles,
  `--semantics-emotion-alert-text` (`#a06b04`) and
  `--semantics-emotion-success-text` (`#197f4c`), which the outlined `Tag`
  reads (`utils/emotion.ts:38–42`). And Tailwind's `warning` and `success`
  colours, which are the primitives `emotional-alert-800` and
  `emotional-success-800` (`packages/react/tailwind.config.js:75–82`), read by
  `Alert`'s variants (`Alert/Alert.tsx:15–16`) and the field messages
  (`styles/owned-components.css:92–96`).
- **Why it breaks:** measured as text: alert 4.56:1 on white, 4.29 on
  `background-25`, 4.07 on `background-50`, 3.59 on `background-100`
  (Kozmos's `muted`); success 5.02, 4.72, 4.48 and 3.95. A Kozmos `Card` is
  white, so a warning inside one passes; on any muted surface it fails.
- **Change:** darker text steps for both emotions, tuned against the muted
  surfaces, reached by both paths (the semantic roles and Tailwind's
  `warning` and `success`). Add the text pairs on `background-25`, `-50` and
  `-100` to the contract (its existing "card / foreground" pair is white,
  `background-0`).
- **Proof:** the `knownViolations` entries for `/components/alert`, `input`,
  `date-picker` and `tag` (all `theme: "light"`) report "no longer occurs";
  delete them. The dashboard's solid content surface (`Dashboard.css`, which
  names GAP-31) can then go.

### GAP-09 · A link drawn as a button keeps its underline

- **Where:** `styles/owned-components.css:261`, `.kozmos-button`; the React
  README tells consumers to put `buttonVariants` on their router's link.
- **Change:** `text-decoration: none` on `.kozmos-button` (and its hover and
  focus states).
- **Proof:** "GAP-09: a link drawn as a button keeps its underline" fails;
  flip it to expect `none`.

### GAP-03 · A dark-mode visitor sees a white page first

- **Where:** `ThemeProvider/ThemeProvider.tsx` — the stored choice is read at
  line 69 and `data-theme` is set on the provider's root at line 115, both
  in React, so a pre-rendered or server-rendered page paints light first.
  Measured: 63 ms of white on a fast line, 1.9 s on fast 3G with a 4×
  slower CPU.
- **Change:** the components must be dark before hydration, not only the
  document. Kozmos declares its dark tokens on
  `[data-kozmos-root][data-theme=dark]`, and the provider root is rendered
  `data-theme="light"`, so a script that sets `<html data-theme>` alone
  changes nothing a visitor sees. Either export a pre-paint script (a string
  or a `<ThemeScript>` for the document's head) that resolves the theme as
  the provider does (its `storageKey`, `defaultTheme`, the system
  preference) and make the provider honour it on an ancestor, or give
  `system` a `prefers-color-scheme` fallback in the CSS. Document it in the
  React package's README, beside the provider.
- **Proof:** "GAP-03: a dark-mode visitor's page is drawn light until the
  scripts run" blocks the scripts and reads the header's painted background:
  white today. With a CSS fallback it fails at once; with a script it fails
  once the site adds it to `src/root.tsx`. Flip it to expect
  `rgb(0, 0, 0)`.

### GAP-41 · `Navbar` has no narrow-screen pattern

- **Where:** `styles/owned-navbar.css:13–15` (`.kozmos-navbar-leading`,
  `flex: 1 1 32rem`) and `:29–32` (`.kozmos-navbar-navigation`,
  `flex: 1 1 16rem`, which wraps).
- **Why:** the leading group's 32rem basis pushes `actions`, `utilities` and
  `account` onto a second row on any screen narrower than about 32rem plus
  their width, and nothing collapses the links. The navigation slot's own
  16rem basis leaves a phone header little room beside it: at 320px nothing
  fits on one row, and the site shows its logo's K alone below 48rem.
- **Change:** a narrow-screen mode — a `collapseBelow` breakpoint that moves
  `navigation` into a `Drawer` behind a menu button — and a trailing group
  that stays on the first row; a navigation slot sized by its content.
- **Proof:** "GAP-41: at 320px the Navbar drops the header's tools to a
  second row" fails; flip it to expect one row. The site can then go back to
  passing links as `navigation` and tools as `utilities`
  (`src/site/SiteHeader.tsx` explains the current arrangement).

### GAP-37 and GAP-20 · SearchBar

- **Where:** `SearchBar/SearchBar.tsx:43`, `type = "search"` by default,
  passed to the input at `:68`.
- **GAP-37:** the browser's own cancel button shows beside Kozmos's 44 px
  clear. Hide `::-webkit-search-cancel-button` (and
  `::-webkit-search-decoration`) in the field's owned CSS, with
  `appearance: none` or `display: none`. **Proof:** "GAP-37: SearchBar keeps
  the browser's own clear button" fails (Chromium; it reads both
  properties); flip it to expect the button hidden.
- **GAP-20:** WebKit (Safari, iOS) does not apply the `@scope`d utilities to
  the input, so the field is drawn unstyled. Move its styling to owned CSS,
  as `Input` did. **Proof:** the `test.fail` in "the search field is drawn
  as Kozmos draws it" reports an unexpected pass in WebKit; remove the
  `test.fail`.

### GAP-42 · `CardTitle`'s line height is 1.0

- **Where:** `Card/Card.tsx:38`, `text-2xl font-semibold leading-none`.
- **Change:** the line height `Heading` uses at that size — Tailwind's
  `text-2xl`, 2rem (no token pairs a line height with 24px).
- **Proof:** "GAP-42: a CardTitle's line height equals its font size" fails;
  flip it to expect about 1.33.

### GAP-43 · Touch targets under 44 px

- **Where and what:** `Slider/Slider.tsx:174`, thumb `h-5 w-5` (20 × 20);
  `Tabs/Tabs.tsx:45`, trigger `py-1.5` (32 px tall); `Rating/Rating.tsx:64`,
  star `w-6 h-6` (24 × 24); `SearchBar`'s input is 23 px tall inside its
  44 px bar; `Chip` 28–36 px (`Chip/Chip.tsx:18–20`); `ToggleButton` 32–40 px
  (`ToggleButton/ToggleButton.tsx:35–37`); the sheet handle of GAP-38. The
  tokens' own `--primitives-touch-min` is 44px.
- **Change:** a 44 px hit area around each (padding or a pseudo-element),
  keeping the drawn size; the search input filling its bar.
- **Proof:** "GAP-43: the Slider's thumb takes a touch only on its own 20px"
  reads what a touch 20 px from the thumb's centre lands on — the track,
  today. A hit area of either kind makes it the thumb; flip the test to
  expect that.

### GAP-39 · `RouteSummary`'s title is always an `h2`

- **Where:** `RouteSummary/RouteSummary.tsx:70`.
- **Change:** a `titleLevel` prop like `POIDetailPanel`'s (`2 | 3`), with a
  way to render no heading at all (for a scene or a preview, where the
  summary is not a section of the page).
- **Proof:** none automatic; the site then passes it in
  `src/home/HeroScene.tsx`.

### The React package is not tree-shaken

- **Where:** `packages/react` — `sideEffects` is already `["**/*.css"]`,
  yet everything ships. The likely cause, not yet verified: the 184
  top-level `Component.displayName = …` writes (185 with the one inside
  `ThemePortal`) and the unannotated `React.forwardRef(…)` calls, which a
  bundler must treat as side effects.
- **Measured:** the site's `kozmos-react-*.js` chunk is 523 kB, about 155 kB
  gzipped, whatever the page imports; the home page preloads 22 modules,
  about 300 kB gzipped, and its first paint was 7.1 s on fast 3G with a 4×
  slower CPU.
- **Change:** annotate the component factories `/* @__PURE__ */` (or build
  with a pure-annotation step) and move `displayName` into a pure form.
- **Proof:** a one-component consumer (`import { Button }`) bundles far less

## Also found, outside the components

- **`@kozmos/react` develops against React 19 with `@types/react` 18**, so a
  React 19 app's `ReactNode` does not fit its props inside the workspace; the
  site maps the types to its own (its `tsconfig.json`). Move the package's
  dev types to 19.
- **`scripts/skills/check-completion.ts` predates the newest components:**
  `STATUS.md` lists 98 components against 104 folders, and the lanes it
  gives (which the site's reference uses) differ from Storybook's grouping
  for AISearchButton and CategoryField (Product SDK there) and for
  Itinerary, ManoeuvreCard and RouteProgressRail (Map there).
- **`scripts/check-token-contrast.mjs` pushes the category pairs inside its
  per-theme loop,** so the dark theme measures them twice; the "218 pairs"
  it prints counts the duplicates.
- **The contrast contract describes itself as "pairs for public semantic
  tokens",** but none of its 22 pairs is a `--semantics-*` role: they are
  primitives and component aliases. The site's colour page no longer
  repeats the description.
- **Native distribution:** the Swift package sits in `packages/ios`, not at
  the repository root, so it cannot be added by URL, and its library target
  depends on Figma's `code-connect` (`packages/ios/Package.swift:13`, `:20`);
  the Compose module has no Maven publishing configured.
- **CI runs Node 20,** which reached end of life on 2026-04-30; React Router 8
  (the site's next major) needs Node 22.
