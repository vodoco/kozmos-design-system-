 * One of the home page's full-width bands, plain or muted. A muted band is
 * tinted and has a hairline at each edge: in the dark theme its tint is
 * 1.04:1 against the page, and the hairlines are what set it apart. They are
 * Separators because the provider's preflight zeroes a box's own border
 * (GAPS.md, GAP-52). The last band above the footer leaves out its bottom
 * hairline: the footer's own rule is that edge, and two would run parallel.
