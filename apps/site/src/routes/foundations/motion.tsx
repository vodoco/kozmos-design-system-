            Under the system’s reduced-motion preference the location marker’s
            pulse stops, and the sheet, pops, reveals and cross-fades become
            cuts. The spinner, the skeleton’s pulse and the button’s loader keep
            moving. The design config’s{" "}

              motion: reduced

            and the duration scale token shorten the Tailwind transitions most
            components use, not those animations. This page’s race still runs
            under reduced motion, because it is the thing being demonstrated.
