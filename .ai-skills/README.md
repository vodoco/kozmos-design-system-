## Quick Context for AI Agents

### What is Kozmos?

Kozmos is a multi-platform design system for **Pointr's indoor navigation SDK**. It provides:

- **6 platforms:** React, Vue 3, iOS (SwiftUI), Android (Compose), React Native, Dashboard
- **60+ components** from primitives (Button, Input) to SDK-specific (MapView, WayfindingCard, AI Companion)
- **Design tokens** using Style Dictionary v4 with DTCG compliance and wide-gamut color support
- **Figma integration** via Code Connect for design-to-code accuracy

### Key Technical Decisions

| Area              | Decision                             |

| Tokens            | Style Dictionary v4 + DTCG format    |
| Colors            | Wide gamut P3/oklch for all colors   |
| Monorepo          | Turborepo + pnpm                     |
| Build (React)     | tsup (ESM + CJS)                     |
| Testing           | Vitest + Testing Library + axe-core  |
| Visual Regression | Chromatic                            |
| Figma             | Code Connect for 5 platforms         |

## Example AI Prompts

### Creating a New Component

```
Using the Kozmos design system patterns from .ai-skills/code-patterns.md
and PROJECT_SCOPE.md §5, create a Tooltip component for React that:
- Uses CVA for variants
- Follows the compound component pattern
- Includes proper ARIA attributes
- Has Storybook stories
- Includes a Code Connect mapping
```

### Reviewing a PR

```
Review this PR against:
1. Kozmos design philosophy (.ai-skills/design-philosophy.md)
2. Component lifecycle requirements (.ai-skills/component-lifecycle.md)
3. Accessibility requirements (PROJECT_SCOPE.md §12)
4. Testing requirements (PROJECT_SCOPE.md §9)
```

### Handling an Incident

```
A consumer reported that Button is crashing on iOS 16.
Using .ai-skills/incident-playbook.md:
1. Assess severity (P0-P3)
2. Determine fix vs. rollback
3. Draft communication
```
