# Directions for transitions, 20 September 2026

Claude Code, in Olcay's order after the glass and sheet stages, on his answer "each platform's
own icon set": the design system's `DirectionType` had four arrows and no way to say a lift, an
escalator or stairs, so "Take Elevator down to First Floor" carried a straight arrow on the card,
the rail and the itinerary alike — the gap recorded since Pass 3. Built on iOS, React and
Android; the Pointr QA app reads the SDK's transition subtype and shows the right arrow. Branch
`claude/pointr-browse-repairs`, pushed.

## 1. The model

`DirectionType` keeps its four turns and gains ten cases: a level change by lift, escalator or
stairs, up or down (`liftUp`, `escalatorDown`, `stairsUp`…); by something the route does not name
(`levelUp`, `levelDown`); a transition on the same level — a walkway, a corridor, another
building (`transition`); and turning back (`turnBack`). Flat cases, so the Figma mappings and the
contracts stay as they are; the web spells them `lift-up`, `level-down`, `turn-back`.

**What each platform draws**, from its own icon set, as ruled:

| Direction                | iOS (SF Symbols)                          | Web (lucide)                      | Android (Material)          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| lift up / down           | `arrow.up.to.line` / `arrow.down.to.line` | ArrowUpFromLine / ArrowDownToLine | Elevator                    |
| escalator up / down      | the same arrows                           | the same arrows                   | Escalator                   |
| stairs up / down         | `figure.stairs`                           | the same arrows                   | Stairs                      |
| level up / down, unnamed | the same arrows                           | the same arrows                   | ArrowUpward / ArrowDownward |
| transition, same level   | `arrow.forward.to.line`                   | ArrowRightToLine                  | ArrowRightAlt               |
| turn back                | `arrow.uturn.backward`                    | Undo2                             | UTurnLeft                   |

SF Symbols has no lift and no escalator (probed: `elevator` and `escalator` do not exist on the
macOS 26 SDK; `stairs`, `figure.stairs` and the line arrows do); lucide 0.563 has none of the
three; Material's extended set has all three, with no direction. So the web and iOS show a level
change as the direction of travel and the words carry the means; Android shows the means and the
words carry the direction. One model, three honest drawings.

## 2. The QA app's mapping

`PTRRouteDirection.transitionInfo.subType` carries the taxonomy's transition subtype (release
10.12.0: elevator, escalator, interior-step, moving-walkway, raise-above/below/through, ramp,
staircase, stairs, wheelchair-lift). `SDKRoutePresenter.directionType(forMessageType:transitionSubType:)`
maps message type 9 (downward) and 10 (upward) by subtype — elevator and wheelchair-lift are
lifts; escalator; stairs, staircase and interior-step are stairs; the rest show the direction
alone — and 5 to turning back, 8, 11 and 12 (same-level and the two inter-building transitions)
to the transition; the turns and the destination as before. Live, Dunkin' to Airport Shuttles:
"Take Elevator down to First Floor" shows the down arrow, "Take Corridor to Garage B" and "Take
Walkway to Terminal B" the transition arrow.
