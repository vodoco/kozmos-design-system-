# The map shell's sheet: fitted to its content, on the surface style, 20 September 2026

Claude Code, on Olcay's answer to the glass stage's second decision
([glass-surface-2026-09-20.md](glass-surface-2026-09-20.md) §5): the shell's sheet takes the
surface style, with the compact detent chosen in the navigation stage. Built on iOS, React and
Android; the Pointr QA app rests its directions sheet on both, as the prototype's navigation
sheet is. Branch `claude/pointr-browse-repairs`, pushed.

## 1. What changed, per platform

- **iOS**: a new detent, `.content` — as tall as the panel's content, between the collapsed and
  the large heights. The shell lays the fitted sheet out in one pass through
  `KozmosCappedHeightLayout` (now its own file, shared with the manoeuvre card, and clamped to
  its cap: a fixed-height child taller than the cap used to make the layout taller than the
  cap — the render test caught it) and measures the result for the detent maths — the insets it
  reports, the snapping — which use it a frame later. `panelSurface: KozmosSurfaceStyle` puts
  the sheet and the floating side panel on the surface style; `KozmosPanelShape` is insettable
  so the surface can stroke its edge. Every initialiser takes the parameter.
- **React**: `panelSizing: "fraction" | "content"` — fitted, the content wrapper's scroll height
  becomes the panel's share of the shell, within the same 0.12–0.88 limits as a requested
  fraction, measured a render late as the chrome is. `panelSurface` puts the aside on the
  surface's class in place of its own background.
- **Android**: the bottom sheet was already as tall as what it holds, up to 64 % of the shell
  (`heightIn(max)` with wrap-content) — fitted by construction, now said so in place;
  `panelSurface` puts both panels on `KozmosSurfaceDefaults`.
- **The hosts**: the QA app offers `[.collapsed, .content, .medium, .large]`, rests the sheet on
  `.content` while navigating and back on medium after, and asks for the glass sheet; the
  Storybook Examples/Navigation composition does the same on the web.

A visible consequence on every platform: the solid surface carries the subtle border, so every
shell panel now has a 1px edge it did not have. The prototype's sheet has one.

## 2. Measured

- **iOS**, `KozmosMapShellContentDetentTests`: a 120-point panel makes a sheet of the handle's
  row and the panel with the map's red 40 points above it and the sheet's own colour 8 points
  above; a 2000-point panel stops at the large height, clipped; the glass sheet lets the red
  through its tint where the solid one does not; an unmeasured content detent folds into medium.
  The sheet's shadow darkens the map just above it, so the map is read by a point, not a bounding
  box.
- **Web**, `AdaptiveMapShell.test.tsx`: the aside's surface classes; a 120-pixel panel in a
  400-pixel shell laid out 120 tall at the bottom, through the properties the shell reads live.
  `test:navigation`: the composition's sheet within 2 pixels of its content's height, under half
  the viewport, on the glass class — 20 of 20 on chromium, firefox and webkit.
- **Android**, `KozmosAdaptiveMapShellPaparazziTest`: the fitted bottom sheet solid, and on glass
  over a red map.
- **Live**, the QA app on the iPhone 17 Pro: the directions sheet holds the summary and the
  buttons and nothing more, on glass, the map above it; the flow UI test passed on it.
