# The Figma drift — 2026-09-21, evening

The importer plugin (`figma/foundations-importer/code.js`) had not changed since 2026-09-14
(`604730c`), so nothing the parts gained after that reached the library. Olcay chose this as the
first of the open items on the 21st. Read §1 for the inventory, §2 for what was built and how it
is modelled, §3 for the proofs, §4 for the run in Figma that finishes it, §5 for what is left.

## 1. The inventory, measured

`git log 604730c..HEAD --name-only -- packages/react/src/components` lists 60 React component
sources changed after the plugin's last commit. `pnpm figma:verify` (REST, read-only) reported the
live file matching the plugin's own registry — 95 sets, presence and variants clean — which
placed the drift in the plugin and Code Connect, not in the file. The manifest
(`pnpm figma:manifest`) and the foundations payload (`pnpm figma:foundations`) had not run since
`fc5700a`: neither knew the glass, motion or category tokens.

Since the 20th (the handoff's scope), what the plugin lacked:

| Part                    | Drift                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CategoryTile`          | the 20th's geometry (64 square, 24 icon, 11/14 caption), the counter at the square's corner, the tint                                          |
| `LocationPin`           | the tint                                                                                                                                       |
| `CategoryField`         | no set at all                                                                                                                                  |
| `BrowseCategoriesPanel` | a 2 × 3 grid of placeholder slots where the React has four live tiles across, in their colours                                                 |
| `POIDetailPanel`        | the Sheet presentation drew a surface, a border and a grabber                                                                                  |
| `IconButton`            | large at 44 (the contract says 48)                                                                                                             |
| `DirectionStep`         | four typed glyphs where the code has fourteen cases and icons                                                                                  |
| `AISearchButton`        | no set at all                                                                                                                                  |
| `Counter`               | the fill (no Figma change: the tile and the field override the nested instance)                                                                |
| the tokens              | `Semantics.Category` (24 colour variables) and `Semantics.Motion` (five style-only entries) absent from the payload; the glass tokens likewise |
| glyphs                  | `pnpm figma:verify` flags 29 text nodes typing a character where an icon belongs (×, ‹, ›, →, ☆, ↗, ↑, ↓, ◉)                                   |

Also drifted, from the 15th to the 19th, and **not done here** (§5): the Tag's and Counter's
`emotion` axis (`61ddc04`), MapControlButton's toggle axes and surface (`dfbefc4`), the POI detail
panel's reference anatomy of the 18th (`a06ca47`…`ad1a23b`), the glass surface style on five
consumers and the navigation parts of the 20th.

## 2. What was built

Four commits on `claude/pointr-browse-repairs`: `c9a2f31` (the manifests), `184ad22` (the tint
on the tile and the pin, the harness), `6006614` (CategoryField, the panel, the sheet, the 48),
`8c50b97` (the direction cases, the AI button, the glyphs).

**The Tint axis.** A category's colour is a variant axis, `Tint`, with nine values — `Theme` and
the taxonomy's eight in the sprite's order (Yellow, Orange, Turquoise, Red, Blue, Navy, Green,
Pink) — on `CategoryTile` (State × Tint, 27), `LocationPin` (State × Size × Tint, 135) and
`CategoryField` (Tint, 9). Each tinted variant binds `Category/Accent/<Name>`,
`Category/Fill/<Name>` and `Category/OnFill/<Name>`, the payload's names for
`Semantics.Category`; `Theme` is the part with no category — the theme's 500 where the accent
goes, and for the field the themed button's fill and ink, the component defaults on every
platform. Fallback hexes are the tokens' (`CATEGORY_TINT_FALLBACKS`). Figma has no colour
property on a component, so an axis is the faithful model: the eight are named tokens, not free
colours, and Code Connect maps `Tint` onto `tint` on all three platforms (React takes literal
objects — its parser refuses a helper call).

**CategoryTile**, redrawn: an 88-wide tile (four across at gap 8), a 64 `Icon Square` at the
control radius with the container edge, neutral under every tint; a 24 `Icon` instance from
the Icons page in the accent (an instance-swap property, `bus` by default); the system's
`Counter` nested at the square's top-right, absolute, 4 beyond its top and right edges, brand
tone, the tint's fill on the instance and its ink on the digits, exposed so its text is edited
on the instance, hidden by `Show Count`; an 11/14 `Label Text` of two lines (`maxLines`, a
`CategoryTile / Label` text style, four component variables). Selection is the accent's 1
stroke, the accent at 5 % over the background and a 1 `Selection Ring` at 20 % outside the
square — never on the tile's frame. Disabled is the tile at 50 %.

**LocationPin**: the tint's fill is the marker and, off the floor, the hollow ring's stroke; its
ink is the number; a featured pin keeps the alert colour; disabled keeps the tint at 50 %.

**CategoryField**, new: 48 tall at the control radius, the accent at 12 % behind a 1 border of
it, 12 before the icon and 8 after the clear; a 28 `Icon` instance (its stroke scaled to
2 × 28 / 24); a 15/20 `Label Text` in the accent (`CategoryField / Label`); a 22 `Count Pill`
in the fill with the ink's digits, hidden by `Show Count`; a 32 `Clear Button` with a 16
x-close in the accent. Six component variables carry the numbers.

**BrowseCategoriesPanel**: two rows of four live `CategoryTile` instances, gap 8, each in its
category's tint with its label and count — the aviation quick access at 10.12.0, one of each of
the eight colours (Entrances & Exits green … Shopping pink) — exposed to the panel's designer.

**POIDetailPanel** in a sheet: no fill, stroke or grabber of its own (the sheet draws the
handle), only its top corners rounded at the control radius, the media and services blocks
white on the sheet's grey.

**IconButton**: `IconButton/size/large` is 48; the contract check, which pinned every listed size
at the 44 target, reads that one from the contract.

**DirectionStep**: `DIRECTION_STEP_TYPES` is the fourteen (Straight, Left, Right, Destination,
LiftUp, LiftDown, EscalatorUp, EscalatorDown, StairsUp, StairsDown, LevelUp, LevelDown,
Transition, TurnBack); each draws a 24 icon in the theme's colour on a 40 disc at 10 %
(`bg-primary/10`, `text-primary`) — arrow-up, arrow-down, arrow-left, arrow-right,
marker-pin-01, flip-backward — with the typed glyph as a fallback for a file without the icons.

**AISearchButton**, new: State (Default, Disabled); a 48 circle, a `Ring` ellipse with an
angular gradient of seven stops bound to `Data/Red`, `Data/Yellow`,
`Colors/emotional/success/500`, `Data/Teal`, `Data/Blue`, `Data/Purple`, `Data/Red` (the owned
CSS's conic gradient; the React comment naming the theme ramp is stale), a 43 `Disc` inset 2.5
in the background colour, a 16 `stars-01` icon in the theme's colour.

**The glyphs.** `productSdkControlButton` and `productSdkPanelHeader` take an `iconName` and
draw a curated instance where they typed a character, falling back to the glyph: the header's
close (x-close), the gallery's previous and next (chevrons), the POI panel's Navigate, Save and
Share (navigation-pointer-01, bookmark, share-01), back, continue, route, save, edit-note and
my-location. `⇅` (the routing swap) has no curated shape and stays typed. Four icons joined
`packages/icons/src/registry.ts` and the plugin's `KOSMOS_ICON_DEFINITIONS`: arrow-up,
arrow-down, flip-backward, stars-01.

**Measured without Figma.** `scripts/lib/figma-plugin-harness.mjs` stands in for the Plugin API
(frames, components, instances, text, vectors, auto-layout, bound paints, plugin data,
component properties, instance swaps; no layout engine) and evaluates `code.js` in a fresh
context, so every painter is reachable by name. `scripts/check-figma-painters.mjs`
(`pnpm figma:painters:check`) paints the variants above and asserts the contract's numbers and
the bindings: 149 assertions. Against the plugin as it was, 81 fail and none crash. It is a
unit test of what a painter writes, not a picture of the file.

## 3. Verified

## 4. The run in Figma, in order (no importer access from a chat)

_Steps 1 to 5 are done in the live file; §9 has the run for the current build._

1. `pnpm figma:foundations` is committed (`docs/figma-foundations-payload.json`): run **Import
   Foundations** so the 24 category variables exist.
2. **Curated Icons → Update**: imports arrow-up, arrow-down, flip-backward and stars-01 by key.
3. **Update** CategoryTile, LocationPin, DirectionStep, POIDetailPanel, IconButton, then
   BrowseCategoriesPanel (it instances CategoryTile). Update renames the pre-Tint variants in
   place, so the node IDs Code Connect pins survive; never Rebuild.
4. **Apply Text Styles**: two text styles are new, `CategoryTile / Label` (11/14 Regular) and
   `CategoryField / Label` (15/20 Medium, the importer's nearest weight to semibold); the
   library audit reports them until they exist.
5. **Build** CategoryField and AISearchButton. Put the node id each log prints into the three
   Code Connect files of each (`node-id=0-0` today) and add the files to
   `figma.linked.config.json`, `packages/ios/figma.linked.config.json` and
   `packages/android/figma.linked.config.json`.
6. From the terminal, with the main checkout's `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` exported (never printed):
   `pnpm figma:verify` — presence, drift and the glyph count should clear; then
   `pnpm figma:publish:linked:dry`, `figma:publish:ios:linked:dry`,
   `figma:publish:android:linked:dry`; publishing is Olcay's word.

## 5. Left, in order

1. `Surface` as a set and a `Surface` axis (Solid, Glass) on ManoeuvreCard, RouteSummary,
   SaveLocationCard, RoutingInputGroup and FeedbackCard — the 20th's glass ruling.
2. `ManoeuvreCard`, `Itinerary`, `RouteProgressRail` as sets (the navigation parts' measured
   geometry is in `navigation-parts-2026-09-20.md`).
3. `AdaptiveMapShell`'s phone sheet: the three detents, the handle, the anchored peek — a
   `Layout` or `Detent` axis, a decision for Olcay.
4. The 15th–19th drift: Tag's and Counter's `emotion` axis, MapControlButton's toggle axes and
   surface, the POI detail panel's anatomy of the 18th (the plugin's actions are still drawn
   buttons, not nested `Button` instances).
5. **Ruled by Olcay on the 21st, late** (`701f919`): the CategoryField's clear is a 32 circle to
   see in a 44 target to hit on all three platforms, as the search bar's clear beside it. The
   trailing padding drops from 8 to 2, so the circle stays 8 from the edge; on Compose the clear
   had floated inward (a weighted spacer against the weighted name) and now sits at the edge.
6. Pre-existing `pnpm figma:verify` findings, older than the 20th: DynamicIsland's compact and
   minimal slots are 26 tall in a 24 box, Dialog's and Drawer's primary-action labels 94 wide in 90. Re-verify after the run in §4; what survives is a painter's to fix.

## 6. Traps met

- A read that strips blank lines (`grep -v '^\s*$'`, a `cut`) is not the file: three exact-match
  patch anchors failed on it. Print the region verbatim with `sed -n` before anchoring, or
  splice by index between two unique markers.
- `check-component-contracts.mjs` asserts the _first_ `ring.layoutPositioning = "ABSOLUTE"`
  comes after the _first_ `target.appendChild(ring);` — a painter earlier in the file with a
  variable named `ring` breaks it. Name rings for what they are (`selectionRing`,
  `gradientRing`).
- Code Connect's React parser takes literal values in `figma.enum`; a helper call is an
  "Unknown intrinsic". The native parsers accept expressions.
- `pnpm figma:verify` derives expected axes from `const X = [...]` arrays and the
  `expectedVariantAxesForComponentSetName` table; a new axis needs both.
- The React `AISearchButton` doc comment names the theme ramp; the owned CSS draws the six data
  colours. The CSS is what renders.
- A helper that falls back to the library's default icon paints a magnifier where a close
  belongs. The default is right for a slot whose symbol is product data (a tile's, a field's)
  and wrong for a symbol with a meaning; `productSdkIconInstance` takes `fallbackToDefault`
  and a symbol's caller draws its glyph instead.
- The icon registry (`packages/icons/src/registry.ts`) and the plugin's `KOSMOS_ICON_DEFINITIONS`
  were hand-kept twins and had drifted by thirteen: the POI card's owned outlines were in the
  registry, never in the plugin, so `bookmark` and `share-01` could not have reached the Icons
  page. The definitions are now generated from the registry with the catalog's keys, and
  `pnpm components:contract:check` holds the three together.

- A lookup that searches `figma.root.children` in order walks the whole Components page before
  Icons. Read the page a component lives on first (`findComponentByName(name, [page])`).
- Update All Core resumes by build stamp. A new build makes every set unfinished, so after a
  plugin change update the sets that changed, one at a time.
- A pasted report is evidence about the build that wrote it. Read `pluginBuild` in the report and
  the build in the panel's header before trusting it.
- HUG takes an auto-layout frame or text; FILL a child of an auto-layout frame, after the
  append. A refused sizing is recorded in the run log, not thrown; the harness now refuses what
  Figma refuses.
- An unbound paint equal to a token's light value is not bound: it does not follow the mode.
- zsh does not split an unquoted `$VAR` into words; pipe a list through `xargs`.
- The linked Code Connect configs are lists, not globs. A mapping left off is never validated
  and never published, and the dry run still ends "All Code Connect files are valid"; four were
  off from the start. The contract check now refuses it.
- `figma connect publish` reports what it sent. Read it back (`pnpm figma:connect:readback`)
  before saying what Dev Mode shows.
- Figma's Dev Mode MCP server answered no tool call for an hour and a half while Figma sat in the
  background, though it still took the handshake, and answered at once when Figma was brought
  to the front. The readback times each call out and stops.
- A bound colour's own alpha does not show in this file; the paint's opacity does. Binding a
  translucent token at opacity 1 drew Button's Glass opaque (`ed50a03a1912`). A token's alpha
  rides on the paint, from its fallback; a strength laid on an opaque token goes on the layer.
- The Dev Mode server has a daily limit per account, shared with any other use of it: some 500
  calls into the 21st it answered "Rate limit exceeded, please try again tomorrow". A full
  readback is 285 calls; narrow it with `--label` and `--node`. The readback stops at the first
  refusal.
- An audit reads the file as it is. At 20:38 two of the run's nineteen sets had been updated;
  `pnpm figma:verify`'s build coverage says which sets carry which build. Read it before reading
  a warning as the code's.
- A render is the truth. DirectionStep's 1.00 was a glyph not drawn; the Selected tile's 1.92
  was an icon not drawn, measured on the fill beneath the one that shows.
- The audit's variant parsers run in a chain, and the Label parser claims any name with
  `State=Default`: a branch on a later parser's field can be dead. The Glass skip was.
- A warning's remedy is part of the warning. Surfacing FileUpload's unstyled labels put the
  panel's next step on Apply Text Styles, and it restyled the whole library. Read what a new
  warning tells the reader to run, and what that does, before shipping it.
- A literal written to a field bound to a variable drops the binding. Apply Text Styles wrote
  each text's size and leading before attaching the style; a painter binds after it writes.
- A plugin that never yields inside a long set freezes the panel and saves nothing until the set
  ends: the panel read NavigationItem while the file had reached SearchBar. Read the stamps over
  REST, not the panel, to see where a run is; the plugin now reports and yields as it goes.
- A new build restarts Update All Core from its first set. After a plugin change mid-run, update
  the sets left one at a time.

## 7. The audit, the same night

Olcay asked for an adversarial pass before proceeding. Verified against the source, not

| Does Update create DirectionStep's ten new variants?                                | Yes: `updateSingleAxisComponent` creates every value it has not seen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Will the plugin's audits flag the tile's visible Counter or the new icon instances? | No: the hidden-Counter audit is Badge's alone; the icon-slot audit counts nodes named `Icon` and only asks that their paint be tintable, which it is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| The AI ring's gradient transform                                                    | Identity is the centred default for an angular gradient; the start angle is immaterial for a ring that turns in the product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Olcay's first audit in Figma: the Button family's icons fail 3:1                    | **Defect in the file and the plugin.** Read over REST: Button Default, Size Icon has fill `#0D44C2` and an icon stroke of plain `#000000`, unbound, while the icon's stored label names the right token — an instance reset had dropped the override and left the plugin data. `syncIconSlotInstance` decided a re-tint by the label alone, so an Update would have skipped every one. Fixed: the paint decides (`iconSlotPaintIsExpected`), the repair is counted, and the check proves a black icon with the right label is re-bound. The one "transparent surface QA" issue is the same icons on the dark host; Build Surface QA after the updates refreshes it. |

- An instance's plugin data is a label, not its paint. The Button family's icons carried the
  right `foreground-token` and a black paint; a re-tint decided by the label skips them for
  ever. Decide by the paint, and count the repairs so a run says what it mended.

## 9. The audit of 14:58, and what changed after it

Olcay pasted a full Audit Library report at 14:58. It named no build; its typography rule
dated it before `fc3e915`. Read against the source and, where it could be, the live file over
REST. Nothing in the file changed after 14:56 until the run below.

Those variants take `Colors/foreground/0`, whose light value is the Icons page glyph's own black; the paint check passed any unbound paint equal to the fallback, so a black glyph was never bound and stayed black in Dark.

What dropped those three is not established. Layer opacity does not depend on it, so the painters stand; the comments now say what was measured (`c28921a`).                                                                                                                                    |

The rest mis-sized: FILL on the Slider track under a control without auto layout, FILL on BottomSheet's hidden Form slot.

### Ruled by Olcay, the same evening: all four as recommended (`ce6e807`)

1. **CategoryField's label** is `Colors/foreground/0` on React, SwiftUI, Compose and in Figma,
   and so is its clear's cross, a control's glyph held to 3:1. The icon, the border, the wash and
   the count pill keep the category colour. Compose takes the themed token, as the field has no
   surface of its own.
2. **LocationPin's off-floor number** is `Colors/foreground/0` on the white disc on SwiftUI,
   Compose, React and in Figma; the ring keeps the colour.
3. **The category icons** on the tile and the field are decorative: hidden from assistive
   technology on every platform (Compose's gained `clearAndSetSemantics`), marked by the
   painters (`markDecorativeIcon`), and measured apart by the audit, which reports a shortfall
   below 3:1 as an advisory with its reason, never as a failure.
4. **React's pin** is solid in its colour with the fill's ink on the number; off the floor it is
   a hollow outline with the number in the foreground and is no longer dimmed.

The contract records them (`labelColor`, `clearColor`, `iconDecorative`,
`offFloorNumberColor`), and the contract check holds every platform and the painters to them.
The CategoryField clear's hit area followed the same night: a 44 target around the 32 circle on
all three platforms (§5, 5; `701f919`). Code Connect followed on his word, published on all three
platforms (below).

### The run, with build `1001317b6546`

_Done on the 22nd, audited at 06:58, but for step 3: the replay in the last section shows the
Tree block draws as this build would, so it needed no Update. The next run is in that section._

`1001317b6546` (`b1d7702`) paints exactly as `314962f54832` (`aa876ce`); since then only what the
audit reads, what Apply Text Styles does, and how a run reports and guards itself have changed
(below). The repair of 21:36 is done and read back: every text is bound and sized as at 20:55
(Update All Core at 22:32, below). Do not run Apply Text Styles on this file, and do not publish
the library until the audit below is clean.

1. Open Figma again and run the plugin; the header must read **Build 1001317b6546**.
2. **Update All Product / SDK**: its 26 sets, the four with warnings among them. The Activity
   line names each set and, in a long one, "variant n of N" and each phase; the bulk buttons
   stay disabled until it ends.
3. **Update**, one at a time from the component list, never Rebuild: TreeItem, TreeChildItem,
   TreeParentItem, Tree, Timeline. Not Update All Core: a new build restarts it from Link, and it
   would redo the 66 sets it finished at 22:32. TreeItem is the largest set in the file; let it
   run while "variant n of 216" moves. If it stops moving for minutes, press Copy Log and paste
   it; do not quit Figma first.
4. **Build Surface QA**, then **Audit Library**. Expected: no warning. The advisories gain three
   from the four replayed sets, 54 if the other sets keep theirs: CategoryField's host-surface
   one (it paints no fill of its own now, as ruled) and one each for CategoryTile and
   CategoryField, their category symbols below 3:1 measured as decorative — the tile's 7 (Light:
   the Default tile's yellow 1.92, orange 2.82 and turquoise 3.00, under 3 before rounding; the
   Selected tile's 1.86, 2.69 and 2.85; Dark: the Selected navy 2.94) and the field's 4 (Light:
   yellow 1.77, orange 2.51, turquoise 2.66; Dark: navy 2.84); 64 of 64 Surface QA instances;
   `pluginBuild` `1001317b6546`.
5. From the terminal: `pnpm figma:verify`, the REST read-back of the text bindings and the washes
   (layer opacity 0.12, 0.05, 0.2, 0.1, 0.32, 0.36), and a render of DirectionStep and of a
   Selected CategoryTile.

### Code Connect, published on his word

Olcay, late on the 21st: _"go ahead and publish Code Connect too"_. Each round went out from
`claude/pointr-browse-repairs`, clean and pushed, with only `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` taken from the
main checkout's `.env` and never printed. A publish sends a platform's whole linked set, so every
round re-sent everything, not only the two new sets.

| Round (UTC) | At        | React                    | SwiftUI   | Compose                 |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------ | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 16:43–16:44 | `45b06f0` | 116 mappings on 93 nodes | 115 on 94 | 110 on 94               |
| 16:51–16:52 | `9c6687d` | 118 on 95                | 116 on 95 | 111 on 95               |
| 17:09       | `ef1b68b` | 118 on 95                | 116 on 95 | not re-sent (unchanged) |

Reading the first round back found two things, fixed before the next rounds:

1. **Four mappings had never been in the linked configs** (`a534276`). Backdrop's on all three
   platforms and React's Icon were pinned to live nodes (613-4791, 15-2) but missing from the
   three `figma.linked.config.json` files, which are lists: no dry run had validated them, the
   first round did not send them, and the manifest counted them as linked. Backdrop read back
   empty on every platform. `components:contract:check` now fails when a pinned
   `*.figma.{tsx,swift,kt}` is missing from its platform's config or a listed file does not
   exist; against the old configs it names exactly those four.
2. **The import lines** (`ef1b68b`). No config set `importPaths`, so every React snippet imported
   from the mapping file's own relative path (`import { CategoryField } from "./CategoryField"`,
   131 imports over 118 mappings) and no SwiftUI snippet imported anything; `PROJECT_SCOPE.md`
   §6.2 meant them to import the package. The React configs now map `src/components/*` to
   `@kozmos/react` and the SwiftUI config maps `Sources/Components/` to `import Kozmos`; Compose
   already printed each file's package import. The contract check holds both to the package's
   name and the Swift library's, and each assertion fails with its mapping removed.

Compared with what a publish from `main` would send, Dev Mode now also shows CategoryField and
AISearchButton, the tint mappings of CategoryTile, DirectionStep and LocationPin, Backdrop and
React's Icon, and the import lines.

**Read back** through Figma desktop's Dev Mode MCP server (`get_code_connect_map`, read-only), now
`pnpm figma:connect:readback` (`98cb9de`). After the second round every linked node showed a
snippet on every platform: 95 nodes each, 1,760 variant or instance nodes carrying one on each
(SwiftUI's Sidebar failed once and read back whole when asked again). After the third, React's 95
again (1,760, every import `@kozmos/react`), and SwiftUI's CategoryField, Backdrop, Icon and Card
with `import Kozmos`. SwiftUI's whole pass after the third round counted 1,738, 22 fewer than
after the second, and hung in the Compose pass before printing which nodes fell short. Asked again
at 18:51 with Figma brought to the front (in the background it had answered nothing for an hour
and a half), 23 of the 95 nodes answered, 504 snippets, every one with `import Kozmos`, before
Figma's daily limit for the Dev Mode server refused the rest: "Rate limit exceeded, please try
again tomorrow", after some 500 calls in the day. The other 72, and the 22, wait for the limit
to reset: `pnpm figma:connect:readback -- --label SwiftUI` with Figma in front, 95 calls. On
the 22nd, the limit reset, both read back whole: React and SwiftUI each 95 of 95 nodes and 1,792
variant or instance nodes with a snippet, every import one a consumer can use. The 32 over the
21st's 1,760 are the panel's new tiles and their Counters, on both; the 1,738 was the pass that
hung, not a gap in SwiftUI's mappings.

**Mind:**

- Publish from this branch, or from `main` after the merge, never from `main` before it: that
  would put back main's older CategoryTile, DirectionStep and LocationPin mappings and drop the
  import lines. CI only dry-runs.
- React's source links point at `main` on GitHub, so CategoryField's and AISearchButton's are
  dead until the merge. SwiftUI's generic components (`KozmosCategoryField<Image>`,
  `KozmosCard<AnyView>`) and every Compose mapping carry no source link; the parsers give none.
- Backdrop's old node, 606-4596, is gone from the file, so nothing is left showing on it.
- EmptyState's and Pagination's React snippets import icons from `lucide-react`, a dependency of
  `@kozmos/react`.

### The audit of 19:00 (build `ed50a03a1912`), and what changed after it

Olcay ran Audit Library at 19:00 with the header on `ed50a03a1912`. Over REST, one set carried
that build: Button. The other 90 carried `c7d1d88351a7` (`414ba00`'s build, the Update All
Core of the morning) and the Tree block's five `dd9f78a05cc0`. So most of the warnings were
the old drawing measured by the new audit, the same as at 14:58: DirectionStep's 28, LocationPin's
18, CategoryTile's 6, CategoryField's 11 and 4, Badge's 3 dark icons. The typography warning of
14:58 (160 issues) was gone because the audit's guess was fixed (`fc3e915`); the file's text did
not change — 11,186 bound size and leading fields and 6,752 styled texts at 14:58, 19:00 and
20:38 alike. (This said "after Apply Text Styles" until the 21:36 read-back below; it had not
run.) Two findings were new, and both were defects in the plugin:

1. **Button's Glass failed in Dark at 1.03** (`aa876ce`). `c28921a` had made `paintFromVariable`
   bind every paint at opacity 1, on the premise that a bound colour carries its own alpha. It
   does not show in this file. Rendered over REST: Backdrop's fill, bound to `Overlay/Scrim` at
   paint opacity 0.502, draws at 128/255, not a quarter; Button's Glass fill, bound to
   `Colors/transparent/inverted/10` at 1, draws opaque — a near-white pill under a near-white
   label in Dark, which is what the audit measured. The paint takes its token's alpha from the
   fallback again, as before `c28921a`; the audit, which reads the paint's opacity, reads what the
   file draws, and its reader says so. Only Button was painted on `ed50a03a1912`, so only Button
   needs its Update again.
2. **Surface QA drew 60 of 64** (`aa876ce`). Its spec asked Slider for
   `State=Default, Status=Default`; Slider has a Type axis, so each of the four panels drew a
   Missing placeholder. The spec names `Type=Single`.

The harness keeps a bound paint's opacity when it equals its token's own alpha (from the
importer's payload, the same in both modes) and drops any other, so a strength laid on a bound
paint still fails the check; that assertion now runs last, over every painter. The painter
check is 224 assertions; against `ed50a03a1912` exactly the five new ones fail: Glass's fill at
1, its bevel at 1, the Dark label at 1.03, Backdrop's scrim at 1, the Slider spec.

Also read: IconButton's icons were bound between 14:58 and 19:00 (their bound stroke fields
went from 90 to 102) while its stamp stayed `c7d1d88351a7`, and the Icons page's 56 sources are
unbound, so the bindings are overrides on the instances. What wrote them is not established; the
Update in the run above rewrites them either way.

### The audit of 20:38 (build `314962f54832`), and what changed after it

Olcay ran Audit Library at 20:38 with the header on `314962f54832`: 5 warnings, 51 advisories.
Over REST two sets carried that build, Button and Badge; the other seventeen of the run's
nineteen still carried `c7d1d88351a7` (twelve) and `dd9f78a05cc0` (the Tree block's five). What
the two Updates showed:

- **Glass is translucent.** Its fill is bound to `Colors/transparent/inverted/10` at paint
  opacity 0.102; rendered over REST it draws (140, 140, 140) at alpha 49, the same pixels as
  IconButton's Glass, which was always right. On `ed50a03a1912` it drew (252, 252, 252) at 255.
  Button's text reads 6.95 in Light and 8.05 in Dark at the least.
- **Badge's dark icons pass**: 6.17, where they read 1.00, 1.61 and 1.00.
- **Surface QA draws 64 of 64**, no issue; its text reads 6.1 or more and its controls 3.08 or
  more.

The five warnings are the four sets not yet updated — DirectionStep's 28, LocationPin's 18,
CategoryTile's 6, CategoryField's 11 and 4 — and two of those drawings are worse than the audit
said. Rendered over REST:

- **DirectionStep draws no glyph**, in any of its 14 types. `c7d1d88351a7` laid the disc's 10 %
  on the bound paint, the file dropped it, and the disc is solid theme blue under a theme-blue
  glyph. The audit's 1.00 was the drawing.
- **CategoryTile's nine Selected tiles draw no icon.** Each square is white under an opaque
  tint, its 5 % lost the same way, and the icon is in that tint. The audit read only a node's
  first fill, so it measured the icon on the white: 1.92, 2.82 and 3.00 for three tints, a pass
  for the other six. These nine squares are the only nodes on the Components page that stack
  two visible solid fills (the Docs page's Selected preview follows its component).

**Replayed without Figma, the Update clears all four.** Each variant is painted by
`c7d1d88351a7`'s painter, then by this build's over the same node, as Update does, and audited in
Light and Dark with the payload's token values. The old drawing alone reproduces the live audit
failure for failure — DirectionStep and CategoryTile with their strengths dropped, CategoryField
with its 12 % kept, LocationPin either way — and after the Update all four read clean:
DirectionStep's glyphs 4.85 in Light and 3.54 in Dark, LocationPin's text 4.57 or more, and the
category symbols as decorative advisories. The painter check now holds this (below).

**Fixed in the audit** (`45e4b0f` and `5639895`, build `53ac76afe679`; no painter changes):

1. **Every fill a node stacks.** The 22 colour reads — backgrounds, text, controls, the Surface
   QA panels — flatten a node's visible solid paints bottom to top, as Figma paints them
   (`visibleSolidPaintsToRgba`); one paint reads as before. On the old CategoryTile drawing the
   audit now fails 21 pairs at 1.00 where it failed 6. `pnpm figma:verify` took a text's
   background from the first fill too; it takes the topmost opaque one.
2. **Every set's text is held to a style.** FileUpload's 32 "Click to upload" labels have had no
   text style since `c7d1d88351a7` — a Medium weight set after the field text style detaches
   it; `fc3e915` fixed the painter — and no audit said so: the rule held a list of 43 sets, and
   40 of the 80 sets with text were outside it (FileUpload, the date, time, colour, number and
   OTP fields, FormField, the overlays, the Product/SDK sets). All are held now, and only
   FileUpload has such text, until its Update. A second rule, for text with neither a style nor
   bound typography, could only fire with the first and said it twice; it is gone.
3. **Glass is measured on purpose.** The contrast audit skipped a variant parsed as Glass, but
   the Label parser, earlier in the chain, claims every name with `State=Default`, so no Button
   reached the skip: Glass was always measured on Surface/0, and that reading caught the 1.03.
   The dead skip would have dropped Glass the day the chain's order changed; it is gone.

The painter check is 242 assertions. On `314962f54832` the three stacked-fill and two typography
assertions fail and nothing else does. A new section paints all 185 variants of the four sets
with the payload's tokens and audits them in both modes: it passes on `314962f54832` (the same
painters) and fails on `c7d1d88351a7` (`git show 414ba00:figma/foundations-importer/code.js`) on
exactly the live failures. A Glass button's label must be measured in both modes; with the
parser chain reordered on the old build, that assertion fails. The wash section reports a
missing layer on an old build instead of stopping the run.

**Not changed, for Olcay:** the focus-ring audit still holds a list of 26 sets. The seven form
sets outside it (NumberInput, OTPInput, DatePicker, DateRangePicker, TimePicker, FileUpload,
ColorPicker) carry fully bound Focus Visible rings and would pass. Interactive sets with no
Focus Visible property at all — Core's Accordion, Breadcrumb, Pagination, BottomNavigation, Menu
and Rating, and Product/SDK sets that draw their own controls, CategoryTile, CategoryField's
clear, AISearchButton, FloorSelector, POIResultCard and RouteOptionCard among them — are a
design decision, not an audit fix.

Also read: the file's `lastModified` moved to 20:42:52Z after the audit with no set's stamp
moving; the token cannot read the version history (403), so what changed is not established.
`pnpm figma:verify` found the structure current and only the two report-only findings of §5, 6.

### Apply Text Styles at 21:36, and the repair

After the audit on `53ac76afe679` named FileUpload's 32 unstyled labels — a warning `45e4b0f`
added — the panel's next step said to run Apply Text Styles, and it ran on the live file at 21:36.
Read back over REST against the Components page as it stood at 20:55:

- **4,957 texts in 46 sets lost their size and leading variables**, 9,914 of the 11,186 bound
  typography fields. Apply Text Styles restyled every text it could guess a style for, and it
  writes a literal size and leading before attaching the style; a literal drops a variable
  binding in Figma.
- **656 texts went from 12/16 to 14/20**: DatePicker's and DateRangePicker's weekdays (in fixed
  cells), FileUpload's description and file meta (its frames grew; 128 boxes moved), and
  ColorPicker's channel, alpha, mode and hex readouts (truncating). The guess called them field
  text; the painters draw them with the meta style.
- FileUpload's 32 browse labels took the label style, the one thing asked for.
- No set's stamp moved and none of the four warned sets' drawings changed: the audit after it read
  the same five warnings, CategoryTile's now 21 as the fixed audit reads its old squares.

That typography had not changed all day before: 11,186 bound fields and 6,752 styled texts at
14:58, 19:00 and 20:38 alike (corrected in the audit of 19:00, above).

**Fixed** (`bd4afde`, build `01f3be6891dc`; no painter changes):

1. Apply Text Styles leaves styled text as its painter drew it, styles only text without a style,
   and binds that text's size and leading back to the variables they had.
2. The guess follows the painters: measured against every styled text as the painters left it at
   20:38, it agrees on all 5,512 it can guess and differs on none, where it differed on 656.
3. The audit's warning for unstyled text and the panel's next step name the set's Update, which
   attaches the style and binds the sizes; neither sends anyone to Apply Text Styles for it.

The harness drops a text's size variable when a literal size is written, as Figma did. The
painter check is 261; on `53ac76afe679` the 15 new assertions fail — the ten guesses, the three
Apply Text Styles outcomes, its styled 12/16 text coming out 14 and unbound as in the file, and
the two remedies — and nothing else does.

**The repair** is step 1 of the run above: restore the version from before 21:36, or, failing
one, the two update sequences, which draw every touched set again. Whether the library was
published after 21:36 cannot be read with this token (403); if it was, publish again once the
audit is clean.

### Update All Core at 22:32, and the Tree block

The Product/SDK sets read exactly as at 20:55 afterwards, so the version before 21:36 was
restored first; then Update All Core ran on `01f3be6891dc`. Over REST at 22:37:

- **It finished 66 of the 71 Core sets on the page**, Link through SearchBar (Text, Heading and
  Label have no set), and the typography is whole again: 5,932 texts with a bound size against
  5,900 at 20:55, FileUpload's 32 browse labels now among them, and the 656 readouts at 12/16.
- **It stopped in TreeItem.** None of its 216 variants had changed, the file was last saved at
  22:32:50, and Figma's renderer ran at 100 % for over ten minutes until Figma was quit, so
  nothing of TreeItem reached the file. The Tree block's five sets are still on `dd9f78a05cc0`.
- **The panel was behind the file**: it read "Updating NavigationItem — 64 of 74" while the file
  had reached SearchBar, 69.

Found in the plugin:

1. **No yield inside a set.** A set's variants ran without one real yield, so Figma neither
   redrew the panel nor saved the file until the set was done, and a quit mid-set lost all of it.
2. **Two runs at once.** The panel left Update All Core and Update All Product / SDK enabled
   during a run, and the plugin had no guard, so a press during a run started a second sequence
   alongside the first, sharing its flags. Whether that happened tonight is not established.
3. **TreeItem is three times NavigationItem's work.** Counted in the harness: 3,672 bindings,
   2,322 appends, 522 instances, 954 property references, 15 property edits and 34 reads of the
   set's definitions, against 1,150, 810, 150, 360, 3 and 16. Whether it would have finished is
   not established; a comment in `updateRepairableTreeItemMatrixComponent` records a TreeItem
   update that sat until morning at the definitions read on 2026-09-07.

**Fixed** (`b1d7702`, build `1001317b6546`; painters unchanged): the two update paths report
"variant n of N" at most four times a second and every phase after the variants, and yield each
time; a bulk run names its place, and its result names the slowest sets with their times; the
panel disables both bulk buttons while busy; the plugin refuses a second run with a notice. The
painter check is 267; on `01f3be6891dc` the five new assertions fail, and nothing else does. The
next TreeItem run says where its time goes; if it is the definitions read or the property pass,
that is the next change.

### The audit of 06:58 on the 22nd, and what REST found

The audit (`1001317b6546`, 06:58:05 UTC): **no warning**, 54 advisories, Surface QA 64 of 64 —
the forecast above to the hundredth, the tile's seven decorative symbols and the field's four
among the advisories. Against 20:38 eight sets changed and no other: DirectionStep, LocationPin,
CategoryTile and CategoryField lost their warnings; Button and IconButton audit their Glass
variants (63 text and 42 non-text pairs, and 63 non-text, from 60, 38 and 60; the minimum still
6.95); FileUpload's 32 browse labels carry a style; BrowseCategoriesPanel grew (below).

Over REST at 07:03 (`lastModified` 06:56:38):

- **Stamps.** The 26 Product / SDK sets on `1001317b6546`; the 66 Core sets Update All Core
  finished at 22:32 on `01f3be6891dc`; TreeItem, TreeChildItem, TreeParentItem, Tree and
  Timeline on `dd9f78a05cc0` (`604730c`, the 14th) — the Tree block was not updated. **Neither
  gap changes a drawing.** `b1d7702`, all that lies between `01f3be6891dc` and `1001317b6546`,
  adds progress, yields, a guard and timing and writes no node. The Tree block's 438 variants,
  painted in the harness by `604730c` and by this build with their 14 component variables
  bound, are identical, and a one-token change to the selected label's colour shows in exactly
  the 108 Selected variants, so the comparison sees a change when there is one.
- **Typography, by layer path** (an Update gives a set's layers new ids, so a comparison by id
  says nothing; and REST gives a text's bound size and line height as arrays): of 7,091 texts at
  20:55, 7,023 are identical in size, line height, font, text style, and the variables bound to
  size, line height and fill. The other 68 are the intended ones: FileUpload's 32 browse labels
  gained their style and bindings, and LocationPin's 27 off-floor numbers and CategoryField's 9
  names took `Colors/foreground/0`, as ruled. Texts with a bound size: 5,593 at 20:55, 943
  after Apply Text Styles, 5,625 now.
- **Washes**, each a bound paint at full strength on a layer at its opacity: CategoryField 0.12
  (9), CategoryTile's 0.05 and its ring's 0.2 (9 each), DirectionStep 0.1 (14), ScrollArea's
  scrollbars 0.32 (4), BottomSheet's handle 0.36 (3).
- **Renders.** DirectionStep's disc and arrow as the React draws them. BrowseCategoriesPanel,
  its grid of live tiles in the file for the first time, showed three faults: the long names cut
  at one line, every count 12, every icon a bus.
- **`pnpm figma:verify` failed its enforced truncation check, 5 times**, all in the panel:
  "Entrances & Exits", "Check-in & Baggage", "Security & Immigration", "Customer Service",
  "Parking & Ground Transport", 91 to 146 wide in 73. The six reported findings of §5 item 6
  survived the run: DynamicIsland's three slots at 26 in a 24 box, Dialog's and Drawer's primary
  labels 94 in 90, and DynamicIsland's "•".

**Found and fixed** (`fc1adcc`, build `7241e855b611`):

1. **The tile's label was one line.** React, SwiftUI and Compose clamp it at two
   (`line-clamp-2`, `.lineLimit(2)`, `maxLines = 2`), and the painter asked for two, but every
   label in the file was a fixed box one line high with no limit (REST: `TRUNCATE`, 14 high, no
   `maxLines`). Set to auto height, then to truncate, then to two lines inside a try, Figma fixed
   the box and dropped the limit, and the try kept quiet. The Tree and navigation labels — set to
   truncate, then to HUG vertically — hold auto height with a limit of 1. So the label now
   truncates, hugs, then takes its limit, after its append, and is read back: a runtime that
   orders these otherwise says so in the log. The harness holds the same order; on
   `1001317b6546` it reads the label exactly as the file does.
2. **Every tile in the panel read 12.** Update All Product / SDK ran BrowseCategoriesPanel before
   CategoryTile. An Update draws a set's layers anew, under new ids, and Figma keeps an override
   against the id of the layer it changes: each tile's count was an override on a Counter layer
   CategoryTile then replaced (REST: `I1960:9243;1923:14151`, a layer no longer in the file). The
   labels held, being a property of the tile. CategoryTile now runs first.
   `SETS_THAT_OVERRIDE_INSIDE` records who writes inside whom — BrowseCategoriesPanel inside
   CategoryTile (the counts), CategoryTile inside Counter (the digits' ink for the tint); a check
   finds every such writer in `code.js` and holds both run orders to the map; and an Update that
   leaves a dependent behind names it ("Next, update BrowseCategoriesPanel: …"), as Update All
   Core does for the two it leaves to the Product / SDK run. The same mechanism should reset
   overrides that a file using the library made inside a nested instance, when it accepts an
   update of that set; component properties are kept. Not tested in a consuming file.
3. **"ratio 3 < 3".** A ratio below its threshold was rounded to the nearest, so the turquoise
   symbol's 2.996 printed as 3. It rounds down now: 2.99.
4. **Dialog's and Drawer's primary labels, 94 in a 90 box.** The width came from 7.5 a
   character. It is now what the instance's content draws, the guess its floor: 158 and 126;
   every other footer button keeps its width.
5. **DynamicIsland's slots, 26 in a 24 box.** The label fit left the stroke a pixel at each side
   but none at the top and bottom, and every one of the file's 136 slots lays its stroke out
   (`strokesIncludedInLayout`, which no painter sets — the runtime's default). The fit now leaves
   both. Why a fixed 24 frame reads 26 is not established — 13 slots of 44 whose content also
   fills them read 44 — so the next verify confirms it. **It did not**: the run of 08:10 still
   read 26, and the cause was elsewhere (the next section). The same fit gives those 13 a pixel less
   padding on their next Update (BrowseCategoriesPanel, POIDetailPanel, RoutingInputGroup,
   MapOverlay, FeedbackCard).

The painter check is 290; on `1001317b6546` its 17 new and strengthened assertions fail and
nothing else does. Left for Olcay (handoff §7): the panel's icons, DynamicIsland's "•", and the
panel's visible title.

### The run, with build `7241e855b611`

1. Run the plugin; the header must read **Build 7241e855b611**.
2. **Update All Product / SDK** — CategoryTile now runs before BrowseCategoriesPanel.
3. **Update** Dialog, then Drawer, one at a time, never Rebuild. Not Update All Core: no other
   Core set draws differently, and a new build restarts it from Link.
4. **Audit Library**, and paste it. Expected: no warning, 54 advisories, the turquoise symbol at
   2.99, `pluginBuild` `7241e855b611`.
5. From the terminal: `pnpm figma:verify` — every enforced check ok, no overflow, one typed
   glyph (the "•") — and over REST the panel's counts (6, 14, 5, 88, 9, 22, 37, 41), its long
   names on two lines, DynamicIsland's slots at 24, and the footers at 158 and 126.
6. Then the library can be published.

### The run of 08:10, and the three decisions (build `6fdc2ffbc635`)

Olcay ran Update All Product / SDK on `7241e855b611` at 08:10. Over REST at 08:12
(`lastModified` 08:10:23): the 26 Product / SDK sets on `7241e855b611`; the panel's counts 6,
14, 5, 88, 9, 22, 37, 41 and its long names on two lines (`HEIGHT`, `ENDING`, `maxLines` 2) —
the order and the clamp of `fc1adcc` hold in the live runtime. **DynamicIsland's three slots
still read 26**, and item 5 above was wrong about why.

**Why a fixed 24 frame reads 26.** After `fc1adcc` the slots' padding is 3 above and below
(Compact, a 16 label) and 1 (Minimal, a 20 label): 3 + 16 + 3 + 2 and 1 + 20 + 1 + 2 are both
24, yet both read 26 — the same 26 they read before. 26 is 12 + 12 + 1 + 1: the slot was made 24
high with the painter's default 12 above and below, then took its stroke, and only then did the
fit cut the padding. The runtime never lets an auto-layout frame be smaller than its padding and
its laid-out stroke, grows it at the moment they outgrow it, and never shrinks a fixed frame back
when the padding falls. No document says so; the file does, and the harness now models it
(`AUTO_LAYOUT_BOX_FIELDS`): painting every Product / SDK set and the 41 Core sets the harness
can reach, the only frames larger than drawn are exactly DynamicIsland's three, at 26 — the
live file's answer, including where it found nothing. A slot now starts with no padding and
reads its size back into the log.

**The three decisions of the 22nd, as recommended** (`1221183`, `b6830f4`, build
`6fdc2ffbc635`):

1. **The tiles carry the taxonomy's symbols.** The eight the aviation quick access publishes at
   10.12.0 (`get_quick_access`: `entrance-exit-green`, `service-space_office-turquoise`,
   `security-space-red`, `transportation-space_boarding-gate-yellow`, `amenity-space_desk-blue`,
   `parking-space-navy`, `food-beverage-space-orange`, `retail-space-pink`) are vendored as SVGs
   in `packages/icons/src/taxonomy/svg`. `pnpm icons:taxonomy:build` generates from them the
   React components (`TaxonomyEntranceExit` and seven more in `@kozmos/icons`, with lucide's
   props, filled in the caller's colour) and the block of `code.js` the importer draws
   `Icon / taxonomy-*` from; an SVG is refused unless it is paths in one colour, and only its
   viewBox changes, squared so the longer side spans 20 of 24. Curated Icons → Update puts the
   eight on the Icons page's eighth row as a "Taxonomy Source" frame of black filled shapes that
   scale. The panel swaps each tile's Icon to its symbol and fills it with the tile's
   `Category/Accent`. CategoryTile and CategoryField offer the symbols in their Icon swap; no other
   slot does, because a slot's tint is a stroke override on a Pointr outline, which does not reach
   a fill. For the same reason a symbol swapped in by hand arrives black and is recoloured by hand
   (both sets' descriptions say so). React's story `AviationQuickAccess` draws the panel as the
   Figma set does.
2. **DynamicIsland's "•" is an icon.** The Minimal slot holds the default icon (the curated
   search-md, or Icon / Slot Default without it) at 16, tinted foreground/400; the typed-glyph
   check stays strict. Building it showed the island drawn at 240×48, 360×180 and 64×48 at 24,
   while React and Compose draw a 240×44 pill, a 360×160 card at 32 and a 56 circle; the set says
   it is generated from React, so it is drawn as React draws it now, and the check reads those
   numbers from the React source. SwiftUI draws the pill 36 high and full width and the circle at
   48 (handoff §7).
3. **The panel's title is hidden.** No platform draws the label (React's `aria-label`, SwiftUI's
   `.accessibilityLabel`, Compose's `contentDescription`). The layer stays, hidden and bound to
   Panel Label Text, which Code Connect reads as `label`, as Avatar's Alt Text does. The Search
   variant now puts the search in a header padded 16 over a 1px Border/Subtle rule and the grid
   in a body padded 16 — React's `border-b p-4` and `p-4`, and SwiftUI's and Compose's layout.

**Found on the way:**

- **Curated Icons → Update orphaned every icon tint in the file.** It drew each icon's Pointr
  Source again under a new id, and each tint a slot carries is an override keyed through that id
  (`I1965:11750;1923:8924;1007:11762`, 1923:8924 being Icon / bus's source): a run turned every
  icon slot but the four sets it repaints back to black. It keeps a source that is still the
  library component's now, a taxonomy source while its artwork stamp matches, and names in its
  warnings any source it had to draw again. In the harness, a second run keeps all 64 ids; the
  sync of `7241e855b611` changed all 56. The live ids were recorded before the run
  (`icons-baseline-before-run.json` in the session's scratchpad) to prove it after.
- **The contract check paired names with keys across entries** (`name: …[\s\S]*?componentKey`):
  a taxonomy entry without a key would have borrowed its neighbour's. It reads entry by entry and
  runs the generator's `--check`.
- **The check's scan of who writes inside a nested instance saw two things only**: writes by
  assignment on one line. A write through `applyIconColorOverrides(icon, …)`, and a declaration
  prettier breaks after its `=`, both hid the panel's new writer; both are read now, and nothing
  else in `code.js` was hiding.
- **`tokens:typography:check` was red on this branch since `a38e24a`** (the 18th): it took
  `KozmosTypography.font(.callout)` for a bare `.font(.callout)`. CI runs it on a pull request.
  Fixed in the rule (`36d04e8`), which still bites on a real bare style.

A replay of every Product / SDK set and the 41 reachable Core sets under `7241e855b611` and
`6fdc2ffbc635` differs in exactly BrowseCategoriesPanel and DynamicIsland; CategoryTile's and
CategoryField's changes are their Icon swap's offer and their descriptions. The painter check is
346; on `7241e855b611` its 32 new and strengthened assertions fail and nothing else does.

### The four rulings of the afternoon (`21f508b`, build `c35a625c8160`)

Olcay ruled the four differences above as recommended. Three are code on the platforms (handoff
§7 has them whole); in Figma one line moved: **the browse grid's rows are 12 apart**, the
prototype's — measured again on the 22nd, a CSS grid with `row-gap` 12px and `column-gap` 8px —
where Figma, React and Compose drew 8 and SwiftUI 12. The painter check holds rows 12 and
columns 8, and fails on `7241e855b611`. The island's geometry and the panel's rule were already
right here. The replay still differs from `7241e855b611` in BrowseCategoriesPanel and
DynamicIsland only, so the run below is unchanged but for its build.

### The run, with build `c35a625c8160`

1. Run the plugin; the header must read **Build c35a625c8160** (`6fdc2ffbc635`, which drew the
   rows 8 apart, is superseded). An Audit Library now warns that eight icon sources are missing
   — that is the next step.
2. **Curated Icons → Update.** Expected under Show Details: `planned` 64, `imported` 56,
   `drawn` 8, `created` 8, `refreshed` 56, `sourcesKept` 56, `sourcesReplaced` 8 (the eight new
   symbols), `failed` 0, and no warning that a source was drawn anew — `sourcesKept` below 56
   means tints were lost, and the warning names the icons. It repaints the Button, IconButton,
   FloatingActionButton and Badge icon slots, as it always has.
3. **Update, one at a time, never Rebuild:** CategoryTile, then BrowseCategoriesPanel (after
   CategoryTile, whose layers it writes into, and after Curated Icons, whose symbols it tints),
   then CategoryField, then DynamicIsland; then Dialog and Drawer, still owed from `7241e855b611`.
4. **Audit Library**, and paste it. Expected: no warning, icons 64 of 64, Surface QA 64 of 64,
   `pluginBuild` `c35a625c8160`, the advisories as at 06:58 (54) — the panel's symbols are the
   accents its buses were.
5. From the terminal: `pnpm figma:verify` — every enforced check ok, no overflow, **no typed
   glyph** — `pnpm tokens:radius:nesting --strict` (CI's gate on the live file; the island's
   slots are pills or exact concentrics, and the panel's new frames draw nothing, so it should
   stay at zero), and over REST: the 56 Pointr Sources under their recorded ids; the panel's
   eight tiles on their symbols, filled in their accents, their rows 12 apart; its title hidden; the island at
   240×44, 360×160 and 56×56 with its slots at 24, 24 and 32; the footers at 158 and 126.
6. Then the library can be published.

### The five decisions of the evening (`022f961`, build `b3257790f931`)

Olcay took all five recommendations of handoff §7. In Figma four painters and one set moved:

- **RouteSummary, RoutingInputGroup, SaveLocationCard and FeedbackCard are the panel role, 24**,
  as SwiftUI and Compose draw them and React now does (it drew the `2xl` primitive, 32); here
  they were the container, 20. Their slots nest in the panel: 24 less the 13 a slot sits in by,
  11, where they were 7.
- **DynamicIsland takes the Dark mode of every Kozmos collection and binds `Surface/0`** — the
  Figma form of the dark subtree React, SwiftUI and Compose now give it. It bound
  `Colors/foreground/1000`, which is white in the Kozmos light ramp; LocationPin's white ring
  binds the same variable (`VariableID:4:171`).
- **Stepper's accent is `Colors/theme/600`**, React's primary, on every platform (it was
  theme/500 here and on the natives); a completed step's ring is its fill's colour (it was a
  grey `foreground/500` ring round the blue), and the pending connector is `Border/Subtle` at its
  own strength (it was faded to 32 %).

The painter check (356) holds all three; nine of its new assertions fail on `c35a625c8160`. The
replay differs from `c35a625c8160` in RouteSummary, RoutingInputGroup, SaveLocationCard,
DynamicIsland and FeedbackCard; Stepper paints its own variants, so the replay does not reach it,
and it changed too. Compose Code Connect was republished the same evening (111 docs): CategoryField's
Theme maps to null, Pagination's example and Box's surface read the themed colours.

**Over REST a bound paint renders its stored colour here, not its variable.** The island's fill
and LocationPin's ring bind one variable, `4:171`, and render `#0B0D12` and `#FFFFFF` — each its
painter's fallback — with no explicit mode on either. So a REST render cannot say what a binding
resolves to: read the binding's id, and the variable in Figma.

### The run, with build `b3257790f931`

It supersedes the run above; `c35a625c8160` was never run.

1. Run the plugin; the header must read **Build b3257790f931**.
2. **Curated Icons → Update**, expected as above: `sourcesKept` 56, `failed` 0.
3. **Update, one at a time, never Rebuild:** CategoryTile, BrowseCategoriesPanel, CategoryField,
   DynamicIsland, Dialog, Drawer (as above); then **RouteSummary, RoutingInputGroup,
   SaveLocationCard, FeedbackCard** and, on the Core page, **Stepper**.
4. **Audit Library**, and paste it: no warning, icons 64 of 64, `pluginBuild` `b3257790f931`. The
   advisory count may move from 54 with the island's content now in the dark theme; paste it and
   it will be reconciled against the harness.
5. From the terminal: `pnpm figma:verify`, `pnpm tokens:radius:nesting --strict` (the four cards at
   24 with slots at 11 are exact concentrics), and over REST: the checks above; the four cards'
   radius 24; the island's `explicitVariableModes` naming Dark for the Kozmos collections and its
   fill bound to `Surface/0`; the stepper's indicators bound to `Colors/theme/600`.
6. With Figma in front: `pnpm figma:connect:readback -- --node 1933-9257 --node 280-1157 --node 170-1002`
   (the three republished Compose snippets; the Dev Mode server answers only while Figma is
   frontmost).
7. Then the library can be published.
