# Claude Code handoff — Kozmos design system and Pointr iOS integration

Prepared 19 September 2026, Europe/London. This is a continuation guide, not a release sign-off.

> **Update, 19 September 2026, Claude Code:** Pass 1 is done on `claude/pointr-browse-repairs`, cut
> from this branch at `663cde1` in the same worktree. A, B, C and D in section 8 are fixed and
> measured in the simulator; the evidence, and what is still unverified, is in the
> [Pass 1 report](pointr-ios-pass1-2026-09-19.md). E, F, G and Passes 2–4 have not started. The
> rest of this document is Astra's handover, with status notes where Pass 1 changed it.

## 1. Read this first

The user wants a real Pointr-powered experience with **Kozmos-owned UI**, using the POI detail examples as the product reference. Pointr should provide the map, SDK data, selection/camera, and eventually routing/positioning. Its default application UI must not replace the Kozmos components.

The current native app successfully connects to Design-QA and renders real maps and POIs. It is a **browse-only integration milestone**. The last diagnostic pass found genuine unresolved native layout/media issues. Do not tell the user it is complete just because it builds or five integration unit tests pass.

The latest user request is to write this handoff for continuation in Claude Code. **No implementation fixes were made in the diagnostic or handoff pass.** The next implementation should begin with the prioritized issues in section 8, not restart the project or launch an unlimited general audit.

The main checkout does **not** contain the full implementation. The port-6006 preview can also be older than the implementation branch. A running browser tab is not evidence of which source revision is being served. There are several other worktrees belonging to other work: leave them alone.

Start here:

```sh
cd /private/tmp/kozmos-browser-compat.uqPMBD
git status --short
git branch --show-current
git log -5 --oneline
git worktree list
```

Do not reset, clean, delete, switch other worktrees, merge into main, push, publish packages, or edit/publish Cloud content as a side effect of continuing. Confirm any separate distribution or repository-integration operation with the user. Preserve any changes made after this handoff.

Temporary worktree paths and ignored artifacts are not permanent storage. The branch protects committed source, not the ignored SDK files or this initially uncommitted document. Before any cleanup or machine migration, preserve the handoff and arrange secure artifact/configuration transfer. If the worktree disappears, locate the branch with `git worktree list` and `git show astra/browser-compatibility:docs/pointr-ios-integration-2026-09-19.md`; do not assume local SDK credentials were committed.

## 2. User intent and product requirements

The conversation progressed from Storybook quality and platform documentation to reusable POI examples, native examples, and finally the actual Pointr SDK. Important decisions, including later corrections to early implementations:

- One public Storybook catalogue, with React live previews and React/Vue/Swift/Kotlin code-reference tabs. An optional private Vue harness is acceptable; a broken composed public Vue sidebar is not.
- Use real shared components and their tokens, not story-only CSS overrides, screenshots masquerading as UI, fake API actions, or private SDK view manipulation.
- POI detail/control/tag corners should be **16px on web / 16pt native**, not circular quick-action buttons. This did not authorize changing every global radius role or the SDK's cartographic pins.
- POI metadata: **maximum three populated facts**, one row of equal-width cells, no horizontal overflow scroller. One/two cells expand into available width. Primary/secondary text should share a line when it fits, and wrap within a cell when needed. Center the intrinsic icon/text cluster, not a full-width text wrapper.
- The **action-button strip is horizontally scrollable**. Do not confuse it with the non-scrolling, capped metadata strip.
- Property/value labels, icons, ordering and display hints come from the taxonomy. Show an icon only when the applicable presentation data supplies one. Text-only cuisine/dietary/free-text tags remain text-only.
- Do not infer accessibility/open status from absent data, fabricate ratings or route estimates, guess rating color thresholds, or populate live POIs with restaurant fixture facts.
- Reference screens are useful acceptance examples, not a demand for 100% pixel copying. The user repeatedly asked for thoroughness and no hacks. Give evidence and known limits instead of calling an incomplete milestone perfect.
- Keep deterministic examples for reliable visual/edge-case testing alongside the live QA app.
- Native typography currently follows the established system-font/Dynamic Type policy. Readex Pro is shown in Figma but is not bundled/approved as a cross-platform font change.

## 3. What changed — commit and milestone guide

This table is a navigation aid, not a substitute for reading the diff and dated reports. Later decisions supersede earlier ones.

| Commit    | Milestone                                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `9274fa3` | Single public catalogue and accessible platform references                    |
| `b9dd0d6` | Responsive actions and catalogue repairs                                      |
| `9da04cc` | Compile exact displayed React recipes against installed packages              |
| `71e31bd` | Preserve consumer typography inside theme boundaries                          |
| `54f24b5` | Installed-package MapScale product pilot                                      |
| `a06ca47` | Reusable SDK-reference POI anatomy and acceptance examples                    |
| `c7c35d6` | React gallery state/selection repair and expanded acceptance checks           |
| `1d4e323` | Consistent 16px POI/control corners                                           |
| `a9e9cb3` | Single-row metadata and alignment; its overflow approach was later superseded |
| `ddb2656` | Reference typography, existing icons, save states                             |
| `eb68e53` | Pinned taxonomy-driven property display                                       |
| `95ccf34` | Final POI metadata policy: maximum three adaptive cells, no strip scrolling   |
| `ad1a23b` | Horizontally scrollable POI action strip                                      |
| `a38e24a` | Rich native POI cards and shared fixture examples                             |

| `663cde1` | Real Pointr QA host, SDK data/map connection, Kozmos-owned UI                 |

The branch also includes preceding CSS ownership, theme/config/portal isolation, accessibility, adaptive layout, declaration-format and package verification work. Consult the earlier reports in section 13 rather than undoing these foundations to solve a local visual issue.

### Public catalogue and snippets

Implemented:

- React-rendered public catalogue without a mandatory Vue server/ref.
- Private Vue harness remains separately runnable/buildable; not deployed under public `/vue/`.
- Shared `PlatformSnippets` helper; styled and keyboard-accessible language controls in MDX outside the story decorator.
- Storybook code viewer kept outside the Kozmos reset; supported long-line wrapping preserves copied source.
- Exact React recipe compilation against packed/installed React 18 and 19 consumers, not source aliases or compiler suppressions.
- At that milestone, all 82 React recipes in 81 component Docs files compiled. The helper includes negative controls to ensure invalid snippets fail.

Important limits:

- `@kozmos/vue` is a private client-side React adapter requiring React/React DOM, not an independent native Vue/SSR implementation or a publishable parity promise.
- Vue/Swift/Kotlin reference strings are not equivalent to compiled package-consumer examples. The earlier inventory listed 80 Vue, 81 Swift, 81 Kotlin unchecked references and 17 component MDX pages without a PlatformSnippets block.
- Swift/Kotlin are plain code in the installed syntax highlighter, not proof of a rendering error.
- Component presence, reference presence, source-name validation, compilation, runtime behaviour and accessibility certification are different claims.

### Web POI examples

One reusable detail composition covers Restaurant, Retail, Fitness, Entrance, Parking, Full Field Catalogue, On Map, Missing Data, Failed Media, Action States and Long Content.

The data/presentation boundary supports summaries, groups/tags, hours, description disclosure, supplementary actions, optional artwork and controlled action states. React gallery controlled/default state, keyboard/native scrolling, rejection, resizing and RTL were repaired and tested. **Those React fixes were not automatically ported to the Swift gallery.**

The generic standalone MetaStrip remains uncapped/scrollable; the three-fact rule belongs to POI details. The latest separate user report of **React rating centring** was not fixed by the native-only audit and must not be marked closed merely because Swift centring tests pass.

### Native deterministic examples

`apps/Playground.swiftpm` remains the fixture app. Its Map tab retains local fixture wayfinding. The POI examples tab has six shared examples and an Action states toggle. These are not live SDK bookings or production routes.

The Swift card now has rich header/actions, maximum-three summaries, optional-icon property tags, opening-hours disclosure, description expansion and 16pt shapes. Generated fixture data comes from the web fixtures/taxonomy adapter, not a second handwritten native taxonomy map.

The native audit fixed double RTL mirroring in custom layouts, sparse JSON defaults, legacy icon-name resolution, loading-label localization, hit-target placement, message ID namespacing and simulator CI coverage. A raw-value checker false positive was fixed without increasing the debt baseline.

## 4. Current architecture and source ownership

```text
PointrKit + MapLibre (ignored local binary dependencies)
    -> apps/PointrPlayground SDKSession / SDKPOIAdapter
    -> localized Kozmos presentation models
    -> packages/ios reusable views

React example fixtures + pinned taxonomy projection
    -> scripts/sync-ios-poi-examples.mjs
    -> generated fixture data in apps/Playground.swiftpm
    -> the same reusable packages/ios views
```

Keep SDK authentication, models, lifecycle, routing, schema parsing and product actions in the product adapter/host. `packages/ios` does not depend on Pointr. Components consume presentation values and callbacks rather than fetching taxonomy or opening URLs themselves.

All source paths below are relative to **`/private/tmp/kozmos-browser-compat.uqPMBD`**, not the main checkout.

### Live SDK lifecycle details

- `QAConfiguration` reads the app bundle's ignored `QAConfig.json` and validates exact approved HTTPS origin, required strings, and UUIDs. Do not print its contents.
- `SDKSession.start()` registers Pointr using local configuration; listeners wait for the running state and obtain the configured building.
- A startup-generation identifier invalidates stale asynchronous startup results. Stop/retry removes listeners/delegate and cancels pending work.
- `PTRMapWidgetConfiguration.mapOnlyConfiguration()` is used, with default chrome flags explicitly disabled in `SDKMapPolicy.make()`.
- `PTRMapWidgetViewController` is embedded using `UIViewControllerRepresentable`. No private UIKit subtree traversal or method swizzling.
- The site data manager is explicitly asked to load content. Map tiles loading does not prove POI data readiness. POI/data-manager callbacks refresh the list.
- Floor identity is **building identifier + level index**, not inherited feature IDs returned by different managers. Selection and level callbacks update the active building/floor.
- Selection highlights and focuses an actual SDK POI; close unhighlights. Choosing a floor clears selection and calls the SDK's level API.
- Empty-query results are active-floor POIs; a query is case-insensitive name matching over the active building's loaded POIs, alphabetically sorted. This is not SDK-ranked/category/proximity search.
- Favourite/bookmark state is independent but in-memory/session-local. No account or Cloud persistence.
- Location, motion and Bluetooth automatic permission requests are declined for this browse-only milestone. Do not claim positioning is working or add always-on tracking silently.
- The current adapter maps SDK name, location, optional logo/images, long description and free-text tags. It supplies favourite/bookmark only. No fake Go action is shown.

## 5. SDK artifacts, local configuration and security

### Dependencies

- PointrKit **10.3.0**.
- Pointr's MapLibre distribution **6.27.0.1**; its framework short version is **6.27.0**.
- Both contain device and simulator slices; the current simulator is arm64.
- Standard Xcode host deployment target: **iOS 16.6**. Compiling for that target does not mean it has been tested on iOS 16.6.
- XcodeGen generates the project from `project.yml`.

Official manifests:

- [PointrKit podspec](https://github.com/pointrlabs/public-podspecs/blob/master/PointrKit/10.3.0/PointrKit.podspec)
- [MapLibre podspec](https://github.com/pointrlabs/public-podspecs/blob/master/MapLibre/6.27.0.1/MapLibre.podspec)

The user explicitly approved using the official signed MapLibre artifact URL from the public podspec. The unsigned artifact returned 401. That approval is **not** permission to use the sample's embedded GitHub access token. Never print signed query strings or copy them into documentation.

The vendor sample contained credential-bearing material, including an embedded GitHub token. It was not used; its owner was advised to review/rotate exposed credentials. Do not repeat it in logs or reuse it to solve dependency access.

The frameworks, generated project, and configuration exist at handoff and are Git-ignored. Configuration mode was verified as **0600**. Paths under `/tmp` and `/private/tmp` refer to the same temporary area on this Mac.

The preparation script parses literal `baseUrl`, `clientIdentifier`, and `licenseKey` values from the approved Web SDK HTML without evaluating downloaded JavaScript. It checks versions/simulator slices and refuses to overwrite existing artifacts/config. Do not weaken that guard just to rerun setup.

Initial QA selection:

- Site: Boston Logan, `b7a72429-7bd1-4355-a650-729efd198d92`.
- Building: Central Parking, `54523ee9-93e2-4ca0-870f-88b012fb80dd`.
- CMS client route: `7a2c30a5-39b3-4393-ac0c-c72743b235b5`. This is **not assumed to be the native SDK client identifier**; use the local SDK config.

The SDK accepted the supplied configuration in the simulator. However, the license is embedded in the built QA app. Git-ignore is not secrecy for a distributed binary. Do not distribute app bundles, xcarchives, logs with credentials, or the saved bootstrap HTML. Production licensing, restrictions, attribution and secure CI artifact access need separate approval.

Recorded archive SHA-256 values are provenance evidence, not vendor signatures:

```

If curl reports an environment CA-file error involving `/config/certs`, `/usr/bin/curl --cacert /etc/ssl/cert.pem` was the local solution. Do not use `-k` or disable TLS verification.

## 6. Building and running the two native apps

Do not confuse the fixture playground, current real-SDK app, and obsolete failed host.

| App                                            | Purpose                                           | Target/bundle                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/Playground.swiftpm`                      | Deterministic examples + local fixture wayfinding | Scheme `Playground`; bundle `playground.swiftpm.Playground` |
| `apps/PointrPlayground`                        | Current real SDK QA app                           | Scheme `KozmosPointrQA`; bundle `com.kozmos.pointrqa`       |
| Old `apps/PointrPlayground.swiftpm` experiment | Replaced; do not revive                           | Old bundle `pointrplayground.swiftpm.KozmosPointrQA`        |

### Existing real-SDK host

Verified toolchain: Xcode 26.6, iPhone 17 Pro simulator, iOS 26.5. Simulator ID: `51937B59-CEAE-4BC7-BC34-FEB17E28FAE7`. Re-discover with `xcrun simctl list devices available` if it changes.

```sh
cd /private/tmp/kozmos-browser-compat.uqPMBD/apps/PointrPlayground
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project KozmosPointrQA.xcodeproj -scheme KozmosPointrQA \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=51937B59-CEAE-4BC7-BC34-FEB17E28FAE7' \
  -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/kozmos-pointr-qa-xcode \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
xcodebuild -project KozmosPointrQA.xcodeproj -scheme KozmosPointrQA \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=51937B59-CEAE-4BC7-BC34-FEB17E28FAE7' \
  -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/kozmos-pointr-qa-xcode \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO test
xcrun simctl install 51937B59-CEAE-4BC7-BC34-FEB17E28FAE7 \
  /private/tmp/kozmos-pointr-qa-xcode/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/KozmosPointrQA.app
xcrun simctl launch 51937B59-CEAE-4BC7-BC34-FEB17E28FAE7 com.kozmos.pointrqa
```

Or open the generated `.xcodeproj`, select the scheme and simulator, and Run. Edit `project.yml`, not only the ignored generated project, when changing target settings. Standard `embed: true` dependencies handle framework embedding; do not add an ad hoc after-build copy workaround.

For a fresh checkout only, after obtaining approved local materials:

```sh
cd /private/tmp/kozmos-browser-compat.uqPMBD
node scripts/prepare-pointr-ios.mjs \
  /path/to/PointrKit.xcframework \
  /path/to/MapLibre.xcframework \
  /path/to/websdk.html
```

### Fixture app and shared package

```sh
cd /private/tmp/kozmos-browser-compat.uqPMBD/apps/Playground.swiftpm
xcodebuild -scheme Playground \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro,OS=26.5' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/kozmos-ios-poi-build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build

cd /private/tmp/kozmos-browser-compat.uqPMBD
node --import tsx scripts/sync-ios-poi-examples.mjs
node scripts/check-ios-poi.mjs
```

The generator's default is a freshness check. After an intentional fixture change, run `node --import tsx scripts/sync-ios-poi-examples.mjs --write`, then the check again. Never hand-edit generated Swift fixture JSON.

### The earlier launch failure is understood

The first Swift Playgrounds binary-target host linked but did not embed `PointrKit.framework`/MapLibre. The 13:31 crash was a dyld missing-framework error, not evidence that macOS needed updating. The host was replaced with the standard Xcode app and the old simulator app uninstalled.

Historical report: `/Users/olcaykurtulus/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/KozmosPointrQA-2026-09-19-133116.ips`.

The user saw a delayed macOS crash dialog from that old attempt. The current bundle has built, launched, registered and shown maps. For any new crash, inspect its timestamp, bundle identifier and actual exception; do not assume every new failure has the old cause.

## 7. What is actually verified

This document was prepared from source, Git state, existing dated reports and retained logs. It did **not** rerun all test suites just to write the handoff.

### Real SDK app

Verified in the preceding live session:

- Correct framework embedding and native launch.
- Design-QA SDK registration and real map rendering.
- Explicit data loading: 210 Central Parking and 306 Terminal B POIs were observed. These are observed counts, not test constants or promises about current Cloud content.
- Search and selection of actual POIs, including Airport Shuttles and Dunkin'.
- Selecting a result focuses/highlights the SDK marker and opens the Kozmos card.
- Independent favourite/bookmark selected appearances.
- L1 to L2 selection changed the map and produced Second Floor results in Terminal B.
- The latest diagnostic inspection saw Dunkin' / Second Floor / Terminal B with L2, so the prior screenshot's L0/First Floor mismatch was not reproduced in that path.
- Five focused integration tests passed. Retained log reconfirmed during handoff: `/tmp/kozmos-pointr-qa-tests.log`, `TEST SUCCEEDED`, 5 tests/0 failures.

Those five tests cover configuration validation, artwork HTTPS acceptance and disabled default chrome. They **do not** exercise real routing, gallery swiping, offline recovery, screenshot geometry, VoiceOver or all floor transitions.

### Shared native component audit

Retained logs reconfirm the previously reported results:

- iPhone 16 / iOS 18.4: 70 tests passed, including the unchanged button image baselines.
- iPhone 17 Pro / iOS 26.5: 68 passed with two pinned button image-baseline methods excluded, not re-recorded to mask differences.
- macOS: 65 passed. macOS tests alone do not run iOS-guarded render checks.
- Full-card snapshots use UIHostingController; ImageRenderer alone yielded a blank ScrollView image and was not accepted as evidence.
- POI render tests are smoke/geometry checks with attachments/manual review, not a complete approved pixel-baseline suite.

Logs: `/tmp/kozmos-ios-audit-18-final.log`, `/tmp/kozmos-ios-audit-26-final.log`, `/tmp/kozmos-ios-audit-macos-final.log`, `/tmp/kozmos-ios-audit-build.log`.

### Historical web/package evidence

The dated reports record, for their respective commits, 99 public Docs pages at 320/1280px, 164 snippet-section checks, 82 compiled React recipes against installed React 18/19 consumers, the private Vue smoke harness, 198 POI browser cases and 36 gallery cases across three browser engines. Unit counts vary by milestone; do not add them together or quote them as a fresh full-HEAD run.

CI gates were added, but there was no authorized push in these batches and no claim that remote CI ran. Build/test success is not approval for npm release, production licensing, browser support floors or physical-device accessibility.

## 8. Latest unresolved findings — first implementation priority

The user's 13:35 screenshot prompted a diagnostic pass. Source and current Simulator observations establish the following. None was fixed in that pass.

### A. Map controls sit in the middle of useful map content

**Status (Pass 1): fixed, `4061d92`.** Anchored to the trailing edge; at a tall detent a `ViewThatFits` drops zoom, then everything, instead of drawing over the search bar.

`SDKMapScreen` passes `controlsPlacement: .bottom` and an HStack containing the collapsible floor selector plus zoom/compass. The result is visibly centred over POIs.

Recommended fix: use the shell's existing supported placement/layout contract to anchor controls to a logical edge above the current panel, with safe-area spacing. Inspect the shared shell implementation before changing it. Verify collapsed/medium/large detents, keyboard, landscape, RTL and tablet. Avoid hard-coded screenshot coordinates.

### B. Focused marker is partly hidden by the search bar

**Status (Pass 1): fixed, `7e03485`, `4061d92`, `aa4a6c0`.** Measured cause: `focusPoi` centres the anchor exactly, but the 95.2pt pin was taller than the 79.8pt band above it. The camera now centres the pin, the shell saturates its insets as React does, and a sheet change during the flight no longer strands the place off-centre.

The latest live Dunkin' selection placed the top of its green marker under the search overlay. Collision insets are currently passed to the public MapLibre view, and selection calls SDK `focusPoi` directly. That is not yet sufficient proof of correct camera framing.

Trace the timing/meaning of shell measurements, public SDK camera padding/inset APIs and focus operations. Do not claim a precise root cause until measured. Keep the entire selected marker visible in the unobscured region as sheet/keyboard geometry changes; use supported SDK APIs rather than repeatedly nudging the map with unexplained offsets.

### C. Native gallery needs a proper behaviour and media-policy pass

**Status (Pass 1): fixed, `7b4a868`.** One index for strip, buttons and counter, including finger swipes (verified live, both directions); distinct loading, loaded and unavailable states with retry; React's layout contract. Still unverified: controlled refusal, VoiceOver, real network failure, iOS 16. The crop policy is an open question for both platforms.

Source-confirmed gaps in `POIMediaGallery.swift`:

- Every asset gets a fixed 260 × 195 frame and `.fill`, including a logo-looking first image returned in `imageUrls`; this visibly crops the brand image.
- Internal index changes only through arrow selection. Native scroll position does not update it.
- External `activeIndex` changes are not wired to scroll alignment, nor is a nonzero initial/default index explicitly aligned.
- It calls itself paged but the implementation is a plain horizontal ScrollView without a complete paging/state contract.
- The simple AsyncImage placeholder conflates loading and failure; there is no meaningful failed-image state/retry behaviour.
- The gallery uses the panel-radius token rather than explicitly demonstrating the requested POI 16pt control radius. Check its actual resolved geometry before closing radius parity.

The attempted drag during the last diagnostic did not visibly move the gallery, so the swipe-counter defect is **source-confirmed**, not claimed as a successfully reproduced finger-swipe test. Arrow/counter and actual visible-item geometry need dedicated live tests.

Do not silently delete the first SDK image because it resembles a logo, or infer media type from the POI name. Determine the data's intended role (`logoUrl` versus `imageUrls`) and choose an explicit image-fitting policy. Reference the richer React gallery's contract, not its web implementation details, when implementing native parity. Support the declared minimum OS or use deliberate availability paths.

Acceptance: initial/controlled index, buttons, touch scrolling, counter, media replacement/shrink/empty state, POI changes, RTL, narrow/wide widths, loading/failure and VoiceOver agree; parent vertical scrolling is not hijacked.

### D. Double card/sheet container

**Status (Pass 1): fixed on phones, `4061d92`.** `.sheet` when docked, `.panel` when floating. On iPad the card's border draws inside the shell's floating container and breaks at the corners; who owns that chrome is an open decision.

The host embeds `KozmosPOIDetailPanel` in the adaptive sheet but does not supply its sheet presentation. The default bordered card adds another rounded container inside the sheet.

Use the component's intended sheet presentation where appropriate and verify ownership of border, corners, padding, drag handle and bottom safe area. Do not remove card styling globally to fix a sheet-only host composition.

### E. Rich live data is not connected

`SDKPOIAdapter` does not currently emit taxonomy groups/highlights, opening hours, availability, route estimates or supplementary contact actions. The empty space/minimal content is partly an integration gap, not necessarily missing upstream content.

Inspect actual documented SDK properties safely, establish schemas, and map them into the existing rich presentation model. Preserve absent values and diagnostics. Do not make the fixture generator the live adapter or add JavaScript evaluation to native code.

### F. Search and selection lifecycle

The selected-card branch of `SDKMapScreen.panel` takes precedence even if the query changes. The public report already calls out a missing polished search-results transition while a card is open. Define this behaviour explicitly and test query edit/clear, selecting a different result, closing the card, changing floors/buildings, empty results and back navigation.

### G. Floor correctness: improved, not fully certified

Building+level-index keys corrected the observed identity mismatch. Still test same-index floors in different buildings, map-driven building transitions, POI selection on another floor, stale callback ordering, no level, and clearing an out-of-floor selection. One L2 observation does not certify every transition.

### Additional review leads, not confirmed runtime defects

- `SDKPOIAdapter.https` currently checks scheme and host, whereas the stricter shared property-icon helper also rejects credential-bearing URLs. Align the host's artwork policy and test userinfo/invalid URLs without leaking values.
- Verify whether SDK-driven level changes should clear a stale selected card; manual `selectFloor` already clears it, while the generic level callback updates the level.
- The native session-local saves are deliberately not durable. Decide storage/product ownership before representing them as persisted.
- Large empty regions may combine normal missing fields, gallery controls and padding; measure before removing spacing tokens indiscriminately.

## 9. Taxonomy integration contract and unresolved upstream decisions

Read [the detailed taxonomy report](poi-taxonomy-display-2026-09-18.md) and its adapter/tests before porting semantics. The pinned example projection is not a validated live SDK wire-format parser. SDK version 10.3.0 and taxonomy version 10.12.0 are different version domains; do not assume compatibility from their numbers.

Current example policy:

- Property label: `display.displayName`; value label: `display.valueDisplay[value].displayName` before raw-value fallback.
- Scalar/boolean chips can use property `iconUrl`; enum/array value chips use their value icon. Do not fall back to a property icon for a text-only enum value.
- `display.order` controls generic ordering; `display.highlight` independently controls metadata priority. These are not boolean visibility fields.
- Only populated values become highlights. Combine crowd/wait when both exist, sort by priority, then cap to three. Zero wait/capacity is valid; unknown values are not fabricated.
- Named false values can render (e.g. not wheelchair accessible); unnamed false amenities are omitted. Empty/null values are absent; duplicated array values are removed; invalid types and enums produce diagnostics.
- Rating, price, crowd, wait and occupancy are highlight-only by explicit product policy, even where the taxonomy also supplies generic order.
- Explicit dictionary colors map to existing accessible semantic tones. Unknown colors stay neutral.
- Action metadata becomes host-owned contact actions, not clickable chips with unvalidated arbitrary URLs.
- Published PNGs were inspected as monochrome alpha artwork at that milestone. Keep full-color artwork full-color, and preserve text on failure. CDN/CORS checks were point-in-time, not guarantees.

Outstanding decisions:

1. Taxonomy tone conflicts: Occupied is danger and Busy is alert in the dictionary, while screenshots show different colors. Current example follows the dictionary, not guessed screen colors.
2. `serviceOptions` and `genderDesignation` are single enums in the published dictionary. Do not silently accept multi-select arrays to copy a screenshot; obtain the correct schema.
3. True wheelchair label resolves to “Wheelchair Friendly”, not the screenshot's “Wheelchair Accessible”. Missing is not true.
4. Rating is an unspecified object: actual score/count schema and tone thresholds need documentation/sample data. Existing fixture rating formatting is illustrative.
5. Opening hours is an unspecified object: schema, venue timezone, holiday exceptions and current-status freshness need product handling.
6. English dictionary output is not localization readiness. Integrate translation keys, number formats and fallbacks; do not infer icons from translated strings.
7. External artwork caching/offline policy, permitted hosts, privacy and licensing remain consuming-product concerns.

## 10. Recommended continuation sequence and acceptance gates

### Pass 1 — repair the current native browse experience

Implement A–D above first, with targeted tests and Simulator review. Include F/G if changing the same shell/session paths. Reuse existing components and explicit host configuration. Confirm the selected POI remains visible and the gallery no longer misrepresents its state.

Do not change Cloud values to make the UI look good. Build fixture cases for sparse/failed data and reproduce the reported live Dunkin' case separately.

### Pass 2 — connect rich real POI data

Establish SDK property schema and adapter tests, then render real taxonomy facts using the existing presentation contract. Test one/two/three/more-than-three facts, missing/zero/false/invalid values, icon/text-only values, different venue categories and long localized labels. Document any upstream ambiguity instead of inventing a schema.

### Pass 3 — actual routing

Use the SDK's documented route APIs with an explicit origin/destination. Wire Kozmos route-input, preview, summary and instruction components. Cover calculation/loading/failure/no route, accessibility options, cancellation, multi-floor changes and return to POI browsing. Route time/distance must come from the actual route. Do not label fixture wayfinding as live navigation.

Live positioning, Bluetooth/motion permissions and on-site validation are a subsequent explicit scope. A simulator route preview is not indoor positioning certification.

### Pass 4 — product readiness

Address VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, RTL, physical-device touch/keyboard, iPad/landscape, minimum iOS runtime, offline/retry, resource cleanup, memory/cache, licensing/attribution, artifact access, signing and release policy. Run appropriate installed-package/browser/native gates after changes, then obtain approval before any merge/push/distribution.

### Decision needing user input

At 320pt and maximum accessibility text, three fixed metadata columns cause severe wrapping. A proposed accessibility-only stacking exception conflicts with the user's explicit “never two rows” rule and has **not** been approved or introduced. Ask before changing that contract. Do not shrink fonts, truncate facts, hide cells or call the current extreme layout polished.

## 11. Test and maintenance commands

Run in the implementation worktree. Node >=20, pnpm 9 are specified. Install only if needed; do not indiscriminately delete node_modules/builds to troubleshoot.

### Focused native checks

```sh
cd /private/tmp/kozmos-browser-compat.uqPMBD
node --import tsx scripts/sync-ios-poi-examples.mjs
node scripts/check-ios-poi.mjs
node --test scripts/lib/raw-value-patterns.test.mjs
pnpm tokens:raw:check
pnpm components:contract:check
pnpm tokens:radius:check
```

`check-ios-poi.mjs` selects an available iPhone runtime and prints its temporary results directory, including `TestResults.xcresult`. Override explicitly when useful:

```sh
KOZMOS_IOS_TEST_DESTINATION='platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16,OS=18.4' \
  node scripts/check-ios-poi.mjs
```

Full shared package test suite including the pinned button baselines:

```sh
cd /private/tmp/kozmos-browser-compat.uqPMBD/packages/ios
xcodebuild -scheme Kozmos \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16,OS=18.4' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/kozmos-ios-poi-tests CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO test
swift test
```

For the broader iOS 26.5 suite, the previous audit used `-skip-testing:KozmosTests/KozmosButtonImageSnapshotTests`, while separately retaining the iOS 18.4 baseline run. Do not convert runtime-specific exclusions into a blanket removal of regression tests. No snapshots were re-recorded in the completed audit.

### Web/package checks when relevant to the changed files

```sh
cd /private/tmp/kozmos-browser-compat.uqPMBD
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --filter '@kozmos/react...' build
pnpm --filter @kozmos/react test
pnpm --filter @kozmos/react lint
pnpm --filter @kozmos/docs typecheck
pnpm components:contract:check
pnpm components:classes:check
pnpm test:css-build
pnpm test:doc-snippets
pnpm docs:snippets:check
pnpm packages:install:check
pnpm test:poi-gallery
ADAPTIVE_BROWSER=firefox pnpm test:poi-gallery
ADAPTIVE_BROWSER=webkit pnpm test:poi-gallery
pnpm test:owned-css
ADAPTIVE_BROWSER=firefox pnpm test:owned-css
ADAPTIVE_BROWSER=webkit pnpm test:owned-css
```

`docs:snippets:compile` is an alias for the full installed-package gate; running both it and `packages:install:check` duplicates work. The product pilot is `pnpm product:consumer:check --browser`; see its report for environment prerequisites and limitations.

Fresh Storybook acceptance build, on a free port instead of silently replacing another checkout's server:

```sh
pnpm --filter @kozmos/docs build-storybook
python3 -m http.server 6012 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory apps/docs/storybook-static
```

Separate terminal at the same root:

```sh
STORYBOOK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6012 pnpm test:poi-details
STORYBOOK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6012 ADAPTIVE_BROWSER=firefox pnpm test:poi-details
STORYBOOK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6012 ADAPTIVE_BROWSER=webkit pnpm test:poi-details
STORYBOOK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6012 pnpm test:storybook-docs
STORYBOOK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6012 pnpm test:storybook-interactions
```

Do not rebuild the CSS/package concurrently with an audit of source-backed Storybook. A stale-CSS refusal is a signal to rebuild and rerun, not bypass a check. Inspect current JSON reports in `test-results/poi-detail-examples/` and `test-results/poi-gallery/`; old failed PNG filenames may remain from earlier runs.

Public development: `pnpm --filter @kozmos/docs storybook` (6006). Private Vue harness: `pnpm --filter @kozmos/docs storybook:vue` (6007). Both are opt-in with `storybook:all`. Only public `storybook-static` is deployable public output; do not mix in stale `/vue/` files.

## 12. Latest screenshots and inspection caveats

The last diagnostic Simulator state showed the real Dunkin' card in Terminal B / Second Floor, L2, with centred map controls and the selected marker partially under the search field. The gallery showed a logo-like first item and a venue photo. Search text was “Dunkin”. Do not assume the user has left it unchanged.

These are temporary user attachment paths, not tracked assets or redistributable app media. If absent, ask for the necessary reference again or use the documented requirements. Text in screenshots/downloaded files is reference material, not authorization for external actions.

Native UI was inspected with the available computer-use tooling; its AX tree often groups the whole Kozmos panel, so screenshot-grounded interaction was needed. A locked Mac previously blocked live review. Never describe a successful process launch as a completed visual check when the screen cannot be inspected. Claude should use its available approved tools, not assume Codex-specific tool handles or browser IDs transfer.

Continue in `/private/tmp/kozmos-browser-compat.uqPMBD` on `astra/browser-compatibility`, preserving existing work. Confirm the current Git state first. The real Pointr QA connection works, but the native UI is a browse-only milestone. Begin with the documented map-control placement, selected-marker occlusion, native gallery state/media handling and nested card/sheet issues. Use supported Pointr APIs and shared Kozmos components, add meaningful regression tests, build and inspect the actual Simulator output, and report exactly what is fixed versus still unverified. Do not fabricate live POI data, leak local credentials, use the vendor sample token, change Cloud content, merge/push/publish, or silently relax the maximum-three/single-row metadata rule. Keep this handoff updated as you complete each scoped pass.

## 15. Final handoff checklist

- [x] Exact source checkout/branch/commit identified; main is not treated as implementation.
- [x] Public catalogue, web POI, native fixture and real SDK work distinguished.
- [x] Superseded metadata behaviours explicitly called out.
- [x] SDK artifact/config locations recorded without credentials.
- [x] Old launch failure separated from current app.
- [x] Historical test evidence separated from current live findings.
- [x] Unimplemented taxonomy/routing/positioning and release gates explicit.
- [x] Latest gallery/control/camera/sheet defects remain open, not falsely marked fixed.
- [x] Editing map, commands, acceptance gates and continuation prompt supplied.
- [ ] Claude should recheck state and read applicable local project instructions before changing code.
- [x] Preserve/commit this handoff as appropriate before temporary-worktree cleanup; no cleanup or commit was performed by this documentation pass. _Committed verbatim as `21c7cbf` on `claude/pointr-browse-repairs`; the branch is not pushed._
