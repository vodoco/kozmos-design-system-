# Component And Variant Gap Analysis

The data blocks between `<!-- generated:… -->` markers are written by
`pnpm components:variant:write` (`scripts/skills/check-variant-parity.mjs`);
`pnpm components:variant:check` fails when they are stale. Everything outside
the markers is commentary and is edited by hand — including the build order and
the reading of the numbers, which are judgements the script does not make.

## Why This Exists

`STATUS.md` reports every component present on Web, iOS, and Android, but it only proves that a
file exists. It says so itself: it does not grade API parity, behavioural
completeness, or variant coverage. This document is the missing half — it looks
_inside_ the files and compares the variant surface each platform can express.

React is the reference because it is the only platform carrying every
component with stories and tests. A gap means "React can express this and the other platform
cannot".

The important correction to the previous mental model: **most components carry
no variant axis in code at all** — the table above says how many today. The other 72 vary compositionally, and
those variations exist _only_ as Figma axes (`Dialog Content`, `Drawer Side`,
`Tabs Count/Active/State`). Code has no name for them, so no amount of native
work will "complete" them — they are a Code Connect mapping question, not a
missing-variant question.

## 1. Real Variant Gaps

Read this against the table above rather than from memory: it moves whenever a
component gains an axis on one platform before another.

<!-- generated:gaps -->

```
Icon
  - figma: component/set absent
Link
  - ios missing axes -> variant (default, subtle)
  - android missing axes -> variant (default, subtle)
MapControlButton
  - figma missing axes -> emphasis (tinted, filled); labelPlacement (inline, stacked)
Spinner
  - ios missing axes -> size (sm, md, lg, xl)
  - android missing axes -> size (sm, md, lg, xl)
ThemeProvider
  - ios missing axes -> dir (ltr, rtl)
  - android missing axes -> dir (ltr, rtl)
  - figma: component/set absent
```

<!-- /generated:gaps -->

Two kinds of thing appear here. "component/set absent" means the platform has
no such component at all — for Figma that is usually a painter nobody has
written yet. "missing axes" means the component exists and cannot express an
axis React has, which is the more interesting gap: `Link` and `Spinner` are the
standing examples, both recorded in `ds-handoff.md` §4.4.

### Corrections made while validating

Three parser defects produced phantom gaps in the first pass. All are fixed; the
findings they generated were **not real**:

| Defect                                       | Phantom result                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Key matching at every character offset       | `default` yielded `efault, fault, ault, …`                                   |
| Kotlin enum regex required a `Kozmos` prefix | Alert, Badge, Chip, Counter, SegmentedControl reported as missing whole axes |
| Kotlin/Swift case regex was line-anchored    | `Default, Info, Success` on one line yielded only `Default`                  |

The headline correction: **the recommended "Android variant catch-up" was a
phantom.** `BadgeVariant`, `BadgeSize`, `ChipVariant`, `ChipSize`, `CounterTone`,
`CounterSize`, `SegmentedControlSize`, and `AlertStatus` all already exist and
are complete. Android needed no enum work at all.

The naming inconsistency behind it is real but cosmetic: those enums are not
`Kozmos`-prefixed, and `AlertStatus` uses `Error` where React says
`destructive`.

## 2. Intentional, Not Backlog

Recorded in the analyzer's `INTENTIONAL` registry so they stop appearing as
gaps.

### Stack and Grid on native — decided

Native does **not** mirror the CSS axes (`align`, `justify`, `wrap`, `flow`,
`cols`, `rows`, `gap`, `xGap`, `yGap`, and the reverse `direction` values).
Product code uses `VStack`/`HStack`, `Row`/`Column`, and `LazyVerticalGrid`
directly, with spacing from `KozmosDimensions`.

Rationale:

- `wrap` needs Compose's experimental `FlowRow`; `baseline` is an
  `alignByBaseline()` child modifier, not a container parameter; `row-reverse`
  is content ordering. A faithful mirror is not possible, and a partial one
  means enum cases that silently no-op.
- `gap: 0,1,2,3,4,6,8` is Tailwind's numeric scale. Porting it would put
  Tailwind numbering into Swift and Kotlin instead of Kozmos spacing tokens.
- `cols: 1–6, 12` is a web 12-column grid concept; mobile uses adaptive sizing.
- It matches the call already made for Figma, and matches how SwiftUI and
  Compose model layout.

The design-system contract here is the **spacing token**, not the container.

### Also intentional

- `Stack.align/justify/wrap`, `Grid.align/justify/flow` on **Figma** — variant
  explosion (plugin README).
- `Text.size/weight/align/color` on **Figma** — Text is a typography
  token/style, not a component set. _Native Text is still open — see §4._
- Boolean props (`error`, `truncate`, `fullWidth`, `asChild`) are not variant
  axes.

## 3. Components Absent Entirely

<!-- generated:absent -->

### iOS — 0 of 98

None.

### Android — 0 of 98

None.

### Figma — 4 of 98

FieldWrapper, Icon, NavigationAnnouncer, ThemeProvider.

### Vue — 1 of 98

MetaStrip.

<!-- /generated:absent -->

## 4. Recommended Build Order

Closed:

- **Vue** — 18 wrappers added; full parity.
- **Stack, Grid, Text on native** — recorded as intentional. Layout and
  typography stay platform primitives with Kozmos tokens.
- **Heading** — `level` added on iOS and Android. Both previously had _no_
  heading semantics at all; iOS now sets `accessibilityHeading`, Compose sets
  `heading()`.
- **LocationPin** — `variant`, `size`, `labelPlacement` implemented on both
  natives, alongside the existing selected/featured/offFloor/disabled flags.
- **FloorSelector** — `variant` (vertical-list, horizontal-list,
  compact-stepper) implemented on both natives.
- **MapControlsGroup** — `locationPresentation` added on both natives, now
  composing the shared MapControlButton so the labelled presentation and its
  accessible name stay consistent.
- **FloatingActionButton, SearchBar, MapOverlay, ScrollArea** — recorded as
  intentional; see §2.
- **Android variant catch-up** — never needed; it was a parser defect.

Remaining:

1. **Product / SDK Figma sets** — the remaining 18, using the plugin lane
   already built. This subsumes the six "set absent" rows above.
2. ~~LocationPin `size` in Figma~~ — done. The set now uses the two-axis matrix
   builder: State x Size, 15 variants.
3. **Naming normalisation** — `Kozmos`-prefix the unprefixed native enums
   (`AlertStatus`, `BadgeVariant`, `ChipSize`, `CounterTone`,
   `SegmentedControlSize`, `StackDirection`) and reconcile `AlertStatus.Error`
   with React's `destructive`. Cosmetic, breaking, so do it with deprecated
   aliases.

## 5. Known Limits Of This Analysis

- It compares _declared_ variant surfaces, not rendered output. Two platforms
  can agree on axis and values and still look different.
- It does not check that a variant is _correct_, only that it can be expressed.
- Compositional variations (the 72) are out of scope by construction.
- Figma axes are read from the importer plugin's registry, which is the intended
  design, not from the live Figma file. A designer who adds a variant by hand
  will not appear here until the plugin registry is updated.
