# Style Playbook

How to change how Kozmos looks, without breaking the agreement between Figma,
the web and the two native platforms.

Written 2026-09-03. Every number here was measured, not estimated.

## The one rule

**A value that depends on another value must be derived, not written.**

Three fixed radii went stale within a day of being set, because a card moved
and the numbers inside it did not. Five padding tokens said 4 while the
painters that drew them said 12. A file row's radius was copied from a
popover. Each was a literal standing in for a relationship.

So: if a number is "the container's radius minus its inset", write that
subtraction. If it is "the spacing step worth 12", ask for the step. The
checks below exist to catch the cases where somebody writes the answer instead
of the question.

## The vocabulary

Name the job, not the size. Changing how the product feels is then one alias
edit, not a sweep.

### Radius — `Semantics.Radius`

| Role        | px   | For                                                         |
| ----------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`      | 0    | Flush edges: sidebars, navbars, anything meeting a viewport |
| `marker`    | 4    | Small marks inside something else: badges, swatches, rows   |
| `control`   | 16   | Buttons, inputs, selects, popovers, toasts — the workhorse  |
| `container` | 20   | Cards, dialogs, file rows: a surface that holds controls    |
| `panel`     | 24   | Large surfaces                                              |
| `pill`      | 9999 | A sentinel meaning "as round as this box allows"            |

`pill` is never emitted to native as a length. iOS uses `Capsule()`, Android
`RoundedCornerShape(percent = 50)`, and the Figma plugin resolves it to
`min(w, h) / 2` **after layout**, because a pill's radius is half of whatever
box it ends up in. Restyling text can change that box, which is why the text
pass re-resolves pills.

Nested radii derive: `R_outer = min(R_inner + padding, min(w, h) / 2)`. The
full argument, the exclusions and the measured history are in
[nested-radius.md](nested-radius.md).

### Border — `Semantics.Border`

| Role     | Light     | Dark      | On the page | For                                    |
| -------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `Subtle` | `#C7CAD1` | `#2E3138` | 1.6:1       | Container edges and dividers           |
| `Input`  | `#747B8B` | `#8B8474` | 4.2 / 5.7:1 | Boundaries of things you interact with |

`Subtle` is soft on purpose: a container is told apart by its surface and its
shadow, not its outline. `Input` is held to WCAG 1.4.11's 3:1 because a field's
boundary carries meaning. The nearest softer step, `background/400`, reads
**2.997:1** and fails by three thousandths, which is why `Input` is
`foreground/500` and not one step lighter.

**A divider is a border**, whether it is drawn as a stroke or as a 1px filled
rectangle. Separator, the menu separator, row separators, the timeline
connector and the stepper connector all read `Subtle`.

### Elevation — `Semantics.Elevation`

| Role       | Light               | Dark                | For                                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `raised`   | `0 2px 4px` at 0.05 | `0 2px 4px` at 0.3  | On the page: cards, rows, a lifted control affordance        |
| `floating` | `0 4px 8px` at 0.1  | `0 4px 8px` at 0.4  | Over the map: map chrome, content cards presented on the map |
| `overlay`  | `0 8px 16px` at 0.1 | `0 8px 16px` at 0.5 | Above everything, with what is behind it dimmed or ignored   |

**The role follows what a surface sits on**, not which number it happened to
be nearest. A Toast is `floating` on every platform because it is a status
message, not a modal. RouteSummary, FeedbackCard, SaveLocationCard and
RoutingInputGroup are `overlay` although they sit over the map, because they
take focus — both implementations had chosen a heavy value independently,
before there was a role to say so.

Dark mode deepens the alpha and keeps the geometry, so a surface still reads as
lifted against a dark page. The token generator refuses a token whose geometry
differs between modes, because a native `ShadowToken` holds one geometry.

Named exceptions. Each is listed in `pnpm tokens:elevation:check`, and a literal
anywhere else fails:

- **FloatingActionButton** in Figma, on the web and on iOS: heavier than any
  step on purpose. Android draws it with Material's own elevation.
- **BottomNavigation** in Figma: casts upward.
- **AdaptiveMapShell** on iOS: a paired chrome, one half casting upward.
- **The colour-picker handle**, web and iOS: a hard ring that must stay visible
  on any colour beneath it.
- **LocationPin** on iOS: has to read against an arbitrary map.
- **Card** on Android: deliberately flat at 0.dp.

Android is held to geometry only. Compose draws a shadow from one elevation in
dp with the platform's own ambient and spot light, and Material answers dark
mode with tonal elevation rather than a deeper shadow.

### Colour ramps — `Primitives.Colors`

`background` and `foreground` are 13-step greys, `theme` 11 steps, `emotional`
four families. Every step is a hand-typed hex today; making them derive from a
base is scoped in [generated-color-scales.md](generated-color-scales.md).

Two steps to know: `/25` and `/50` were added on 2026-09-02 because the ramp
jumped from white straight to `/100`, so a hovered row and a chosen row could
not be told apart. Active rows use `/50`, selected rows `/100`.

### Spacing — `Primitives.Layout.spacing`

The step names are the arithmetic: **`spacing/N` is N ÷ 12.5 px**. So 50 is 4,
75 is 6, 150 is 12, 200 is 16. The plugin has both directions,
`spacingAliasFor(px)` and `spacingPx(step)`; use them rather than typing an
alias next to a value, because a typed alias silently wins over the value it
sits beside.

## Cookbook

### Change how round the product feels

Edit one alias in `packages/tokens/src/tokens-light.json` and its twin in
`tokens-dark.json`, under `Semantics.Radius`. Then:

```bash
pnpm tokens:build && pnpm figma:foundations && pnpm tokens:radius:check
```

Everything derived follows. Nothing else needs editing — that is the whole
point of the role.

### Change a border colour

Edit `Semantics.Border.Subtle` or `.Input` in both token files. Then the same
build, plus:

```bash
pnpm tokens:border:check
```

That check refuses a `Subtle` at or above 3:1 and an `Input` below it, so the
accessible boundary cannot be softened away by accident.

### Change how raised things feel

Edit `shadow.sm`, `md` or `lg` in both token files — the elevation roles alias
them — then:

```bash
pnpm tokens:build && pnpm tokens:elevation:check
```

The check compares the tracked native files against both token files, so it
names `packages/ios/Sources/KozmosShadows.swift` and the Android
`KozmosShadows.kt` until they carry the new numbers. They are hand-maintained
copies of what the generator writes to `packages/tokens/dist`; copy the values
across rather than re-deriving them.

### Add a colour step

Add it to `Primitives.Colors.<ramp>` in **both** token files, then rebuild and
regenerate the payload. It reaches Figma only through an import — see the
Figma loop below. Until the import runs, painters fall back to their literal
hex and the audit reports contrast failures that no component Update can fix.

### Change a component's geometry

Component numbers live in one table in `figma/foundations-importer/code.js`
(search `name: "<Component>/`). Each entry is `{ name, value, alias, scopes }`.

- If the number depends on another number, write the expression.
- If the alias is a spacing step, produce it with `spacingAliasFor(value)`.
- The **alias wins over the value** at runtime, so never leave a typed alias
  beside a derived value.

Then Update that set in the plugin and verify.

### Add a new component

Give it a `build-`, `update-` and `rebuild-` handler, and add its update
function to `CORE_UPDATE_SEQUENCE`. `pnpm components:contract:check` fails if
you forget the sequence entry, because a bulk action that quietly skips a set
is worse than none: the skipped sets look updated because the run reported
success.

## The traps

Each of these cost real time. They fail silently, which is what makes them
expensive.

**A bound property ignores the painter.** Most layout properties on generated
nodes are bound to component variables. A bound property renders the
variable's value; a raw `paddingLeft = 12` in a painter changes nothing. When
the file disagrees with the code, read `boundVariables` on the node first
(`pnpm tokens:radius:nesting` prints them on every finding) and fix the entry
in the token table.

**Corners bind one at a time.** A radius bound through the variables panel
arrives over the REST API as `rectangleCornerRadii`, four aliases in one
object, while `boundVariables.cornerRadius` stays empty. Reading only the
latter is how one stale variable passed for "not bound" for a day.

**Figma runs stale plugin code.** It reads a development plugin's files when
the plugin _launches_. Quit Figma entirely (⌘Q) and relaunch after every
change to `code.js` — reopening the panel is not enough.

**Never press Rebuild.** It mints new node IDs, and Code Connect pins the old
ones. Update preserves them. Rebuild is for a set that does not exist yet.

**"Found" is not "loaded".** The Setup badge says Found when the _file_ already
has foundations. The payload picker is separate, and Import Foundations stays
disabled until a payload is parsed. An audit that keeps reporting the same
contrast failures after every Update, with the Variables count unchanged,
means the import never ran.

**Two checkouts, two payloads.** There is a second clone at
`P/Pointr Cloud/kozmos-design-system-` with an older payload. Figma is
registered to run the plugin from `K/kozmos-design-system-dev`, and the
payload must come from the same place. The status line should read **620
token candidates**; 615 means the wrong file.

**The audit's rules must agree with the painters.** Twice in one day a text
rule expected a different style from the one the painter applies. The audit
then reports stale text that no Update can clear, and Apply Text Styles
rewrites the node to the rule's style, which can resize a box and strand
anything derived from it. When a stale-text count survives an Update, compare
`inferTextStyleKeyForComponentText` with the painter before touching the file.

**A set may only declare what its rows render.** A property bound to no layer
blocks publishing the whole library with "Invalid assets". One is enough.

**A check that names its consumers can only confirm what someone already
looked at.** The elevation check passed for a day while 44 raw shadow
classes sat in 29 components it did not name, and a Figma helper called by
thirteen painters counted as a single literal because the check counted
occurrences. Scan everything and name only the exceptions; count reach, not
sites. `tokens:raw:check` exists because every other parity check had this
shape.

**A quiet file is not a stalled run.** Figma cannot save while the plugin holds
the thread, so `lastModified` can sit still for forty minutes while a bulk run
works through the Tree sets. The runner now yields between sets, but the rule
stands: a jump in saved sets after a silence is the only honest signal, and
quitting to unstick a run throws that work away.

## The checks

All of these run in CI. Run them locally before pushing; the whole set takes
under a minute apart from the two that call Figma.

| Command                          | Guards                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm tokens:radius:check`       | Plugin, Tailwind and native agree with `Semantics.Radius`                |
| `pnpm tokens:border:check`       | Every consumer reads `Semantics.Border`, and the contrast bands          |
| `pnpm tokens:elevation:check`    | Every platform reads `Semantics.Elevation`; native values in both themes |
| `pnpm tokens:raw:check`          | No new value bypasses a role — a ratchet over a recorded backlog         |
| `pnpm tokens:contrast:check`     | 50 text pairs clear WCAG AA in both themes                               |
| `pnpm tokens:typography:check`   | Type scale parity                                                        |
| `pnpm components:contract:check` | Variant axes, props, and the bulk sequences' completeness                |
| `pnpm figma:plugin:check`        | The plugin's restricted syntax (no spread, `?.` or `??`)                 |
| `pnpm native:check`              | Both native packages compile, the way CI's two build jobs do             |
| `pnpm tokens:radius:nesting`     | **Reads the live Figma file.** Concentric radii; `--strict` in CI        |
| `pnpm figma:verify`              | **Reads the live Figma file.** Six publishing checks                     |

The two that read Figma need `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `.env`. In CI they skip
with a notice when the secret is absent, so a fork's build still passes.

`native:check` compiles Swift and Kotlin locally in about six seconds, which
is the difference between finding a typo now and finding it eight minutes into
a pull request. It takes an optional `ios` or `android` argument.

**Android needs one line of machine-local setup.** The SDK is usually already
installed at `~/Library/Android/sdk`, but Gradle cannot find it unless
`ANDROID_HOME` is set or `packages/android/local.properties` exists:

```bash
echo "sdk.dir=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk" > packages/android/local.properties
```

That file is gitignored, so it stays on your machine. Without it the native
elevation rollout went to CI with its Kotlin half unverified — not because
compiling locally was hard, but because nothing said how. `native:check` now
prints this exact command rather than only reporting that a toolchain is
missing, and skips instead of failing where a platform genuinely cannot build
(a Linux checkout has no Xcode, and that is not an error).

`figma:verify` is the cheap way to tell whether a plugin run actually landed:
it reads the file, not the plugin's own report.

## The Figma loop

In order, every time:

1. **⌘Q Figma** if `code.js` changed, and relaunch.
2. **Import** if tokens changed: Setup → Payload file →
   `docs/figma-foundations-payload.json` **from this checkout** → confirm the
   token-candidate count → untick _Create pages_ and _Create foundations
   overview frame_ → **Import Foundations** → wait for "Foundations import
   complete."
3. **Update** the affected sets. `Update All Core` covers 73 sets and
   `Update All Product / SDK` covers 24; both preserve node IDs and reorganize
   once at the end. Never Rebuild. A run that dies partway resumes: pressing
   the button again skips every set already finished on this build.
4. **Verify from the terminal**, not from the plugin's audit alone:
   ```bash
   pnpm figma:verify && pnpm tokens:radius:nesting
   ```

## Where things live

| Thing                        | Path                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Token source (both modes)    | `packages/tokens/src/tokens-{light,dark}.json`    |
| Token build                  | `packages/tokens/build.mjs`                       |
| Figma importer plugin        | `figma/foundations-importer/code.js`, `ui.html`   |
| Component number table       | same file, search `name: "<Component>/`           |
| Foundations payload          | `docs/figma-foundations-payload.json` (generated) |
| Web colour and radius map    | `packages/react/tailwind.config.js`               |
| Native colour and dimensions | `packages/{ios/Sources,android/src/...}/Kozmos*`  |
| Checks                       | `scripts/check-*.mjs`                             |

The Figma file is `Yj4O8p6Y9h2Sa9zJVoAiVY`, Components page node `4:4`.

## Known gaps

Recorded so nobody rediscovers them:

- **`Semantics.Surface` 100–300 are hand-typed hexes** that are not on the
  `background` ramp. They predate the ramp and nothing reconciles them.
- **The dark grey ramp is warm-tinted** (`#8B8474`) while the light one is cool
  (`#747B8B`). Visible when toggling modes.
- **The tracked native colour files are a frozen May baseline** that has drifted
  from the generator's output, and 29 native border references still hard-code
  the old grey rather than reading the role.
- **Two overflow findings remain** and are accepted: Dialog and Drawer give
  their primary action a long label in a fixed-width button, so the text takes
  2px of the button's 32px padding. `figma:verify` reports the overflow check
  without failing on it; add it to the failing total on the day someone decides
  those two are worth changing.
- **Off-scale icon sizes**: 18px in NavigationItem, Sidebar and SearchBar where
  the web uses 20; 14px in IconButton, Tag and Breadcrumb. The scale is
  12/16/20/24.
- **Text stragglers**: 14/22 in Card, POICard, POIDetailPanel and
  WayfindingCard; 16/20 in EmptyState.
- **An off-ramp surface**, `#E4E6EA`, on 67 variants of SegmentedControl, Chip,
  ToggleButton and Box.
- **Screen breakpoints are emitted 16× inflated** to native.
- **Figma's TimePicker models an open dropdown; the web's does not** render one
  at all, so the two disagree structurally rather than stylistically.
- **No glass surface role.** FeedbackCard, RoutingInputGroup and
  SaveLocationCard each repeat `bg-white/70 dark:bg-black/70 backdrop-blur-3xl
ring-1 ring-black/5` — 29 of the 35 raw colours `tokens:raw:check` counts.
- **19 Figma sets cast no shadow** where at least one implementation does. The
  list is in `docs/session-handoff.md` §4.
- **Card disagrees across platforms**: raised on the web and iOS, flat on
  Android. **The iOS FloatingActionButton** uses a bare SwiftUI default where
  Figma paints it heavier than any step.
- **`KozmosColors` on macOS tests for dark with `appearance.name == .darkAqua`**,
  which misses the vibrant and high-contrast dark appearances. The shadow helper
  uses `bestMatch(from:)`; the colour file predates it.
