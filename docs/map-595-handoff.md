# MAP-595 — handoff for the next session

Written 2026-09-12, patched 2026-09-13 morning (the record runs §1–§199, the last with an addendum). Every node ID, hash
and number below was read back from the Figma file, the repo and the record at the time of writing.
The earlier handoffs are archived at `docs/archive/map-595-handoff-2026-09-11-a.md` (morning) and
`docs/archive/map-595-handoff-2026-09-11-b.md` (evening); nothing in them overrides this one.

Read order: this file → the record's "Where it stands" → §198–§199 → the three change lists
(`docs/map-595-file-changes-2026-09-12.md`, `docs/map-595-file-changes-2026-09-11-pm.md`,
`docs/map-595-stories-revision-2026-09-11.md`) → the memory files named in §7.

## 1 · The work, and how Olcay works

- **What:** MAP-595 "Easier Content Editing — Part 2" at Pointr: editing map content in the Map Content
  screen — one-click selection (US1), leaving and switching (US2), copy and paste (US3), several at
  once (US4), Transform on the floor plan alignment page (US5), ten alignment snaps (US6), metadata in
  its own panel (US7), search results that stay (US8). The stories live in their own document (revised
  2026-09-11, no longer a draft); ④ links to it and summarises each story. **The Figma file is the
  team's reference for QA and implementation** (Olcay, 2026-09-11) — "the rest of the team doesn't
  need to know about the prototype and its notes". No note in the file names the prototype, its code,
  the record or a person's ruling; notes speak of the product, the stories and the file — where a
  drawing follows the implementation the note says "as implemented" (§198). ① quotes Olcay's rulings.
- **The prototype** matters only as a source of measured behaviour (§7 says where the geometry
  numbers came from). Do not touch `apps/mapscale-review`, PR #17, CI or iOS unless asked.
- **The standing instruction** — Olcay repeats it; treat it as the default mode:

  > "Once more, please analyse extensively to see if anything is overlooked, missed,
  > mis-implemented or could have done better. No hacks - no cheats - do it propertly and perfectly.
  > Otherwise please proceed with your recommendation. Provide me everything I'd need if I need to
  > make changes myself. But remember you have CLI access. I don't want to miss anything"

- **How Olcay likes it:** an adversarial self-audit before "done"; verify by measuring and rendering,
  never assert; decisions as short multiple-choice questions with the recommended option first, and
  "proceed with your recommendation" means every recommended option, including a PR edit that the
  recommendation named; every change in the record with its numbers; a change list a person can redo
  by hand; mistakes stated plainly; pushes and merges only on a go-ahead; commits only when asked
  ("commit the docs").

## 2 · Where everything is

**The Figma file** `nm6qdzaC9B1lknllbwaMTh`, "[MAP-595] Easier Content Editing — Part 2". Pages
(never deleted — only notes about unrelated things go): 📕 Cover `0:1` · 📑 Contents `1:2` (its seven titles link to their pages since 2026-09-13) · ① Context
& decisions `1:3` · ② Research `1:4` · ③ Flows `1:5` · ④ User Stories `1:6` · ⑥ True vs
Representative `1:8` · ⑤ UI Kit `1:7` · ⑦ Handover `1:9` · 🛠 Workbench `20:4`.

**③ Flows** — one section per story, each: title, a one-paragraph intent, numbered step cards
(380 wide, 400 pitch), ⚠️ notes (glyph at x 80, text at x 104, 28px pitch), a coverage box on US1
and US7, then the screens (1440×900, two per row at x 80 and 1600, caption 12px under each).
Sections and screens:

| Section       | y     | Screens                                                                                                                                                                 |

Every Map Content screen is a clone of a pasted v9 frame: `headerMenu` + `body` (rail `sideMenu`,
list `mapContentSideDrawer` 440 wide, `mapBody` 904×844). Inside `mapBody`, in order: the map
instance (its "Mapsicle Map" image fill is the per-state bitmap), the **geometry states** clipping
frame (index 1), the toast, `topLeft` (hidden), the Building-Level Selector (x 312, or 518 beside a
panel), then the panel / menu / toolbar / checklist / overlay instances, and the **Map View
Preferences button** (16, 796 — or x 428 while the panel is open). The **geometry bar** sits bottom
centre with no panel (US1·a: 224, 764) and, beside an open panel, docks under the selector at
(430, 102) — drawn on US7·b only. US2 and US1·d carry their scrim
and overlay at the ROOT's indices 0 and 1 (the root stacks first-on-top). The panel instances on the
screens are 400×820 (their own size); US1·c's two are 651 (they follow the master). Data conventions:
the selected feature is **Check-in 3** everywhere (panel header, Section "Bag Drop / Check-in", Name,
the Delete question, the Saved notice); one lit list row; the selector reads **Ground Floor (GF)**,
the floor the list has expanded.

**⑤ UI Kit** — the panel section `406:988` (x 0–3016) holds:

Also on ⑤: the ten toolbar state bars (`102:709`… — two Combine examples marked SUPERSEDED), the
Transform anatomy section `122:1148` (drawn at the SVG's rendered sizes), the snap family and the
ten US6 snaps at true size, the layer sections, the six custom controls and the type picker
(the Textarea's error state `486:1550` in the product's red `#b42318`), the accordion proposal
`392:900` (kept as the case against). Dev Mode descriptions on every set say what it does — read
them knowing the API getter returns them HTML-escaped (§7).

**Other pages:** ① the scope list and the decision log (46px rows; eight rows dated 2026-09-12 at
y 2183–2505, page bottom 2536); ④ one row per story with "WHERE IT IS DRAWN" links (all 24 resolve);
⑥ one line per drawn thing, TRUE / REPRESENTATIVE / MIXED; ⑦ the coverage table, developer notes,
the keyboard list, the open-decisions table with an owner each (the last two rows: the bar beside
the panel `797:993`, ✅ settled 2026-09-12; input border contrast `908:18618`, owner product · Kozmos DS),
and the panel's developer notes at the end (heading `743:302` at y 2810, eight notes from 2852,
page bottom 3048).

**🛠 Workbench:** Chris's mock-ups `20:11` (untouched, by ruling); the v9 sources at x ≥ 9200
(`807:10227` Default Contextual Menu, `807:11850` Overlapping Features, `807:12844` placement,
`807:26970` Adding Level, `872:35961` Map View Preferences + button) under their own heading; two
2026-08 exploration frames (`46:15`, `59:62`) marked superseded; the C frame `589:1079` as a pointer;
a hidden "stray grey rectangle" `256:97` kept as evidence.

**The dashboard's own file** (read-only, unpublished): Pointr Cloud Dashboard v9
`b8dqhE3CPxitYfqlXuQJTC` — page "0 - Common UI Components" (PreferencesOverlay `19452:258615`, the
error overlay `7581:268934`), page "2.5 - Map Content", page "2.4 - Levels". It publishes only
`listItem`; everything else arrives by copy-paste through the desktop app (§7).

**The docs:** the record `docs/map-595-figma-2026-09-07.md` ("Where it stands" at the top, then
§1–§198); the change lists `docs/map-595-file-changes-2026-09-12.md` (today),
`docs/map-595-file-changes-2026-09-11-pm.md`, `docs/map-595-stories-revision-2026-09-11.md`; the
bitmap pipeline `docs/map-595-assets/` (the 2× source render, `geometry.json`, `retouch-map.py`).

**The stories document:** Google Doc, linked from ④ (`157:12`). US9–US10 are empty stubs.

**Git:** branch `codex/wayfinding-map-panel`; origin is at `3e5c084` (the 2026-09-11 handoff);
`ddd2e7b`, `e326144` and `a05697b` carry the 2026-09-12/13 docs and are **pushed** (Olcay,
2026-09-13: "push the branch"). PR #17 targets `main`, retitled 2026-09-12.

## 3 · Decided — do not reopen

Olcay's rulings, each in ①'s decision log and the record.

1. **The file is the team's reference; the prototype is out of it** (2026-09-11, §190).
2. **Colours are the product's own tokens** — the dashboard's four-mode Primitive Tokens cached in
   the file, Kozmos DS 2.0 `Primitives` where a step is missing; never Kozmos DS - Core Library on the
   file's own layers (2026-09-11). Switches `theme/500` `#346df1`. The file's own annotation palette
   (callouts, status chips, coverage boxes, legend dots, swatches) stays raw (2026-09-12, §198).
3. **Pages are never deleted; Chris's mock-ups stay as they are** (2026-09-11).
4. **③'s screens use the actual components on the dashboard's own chrome** (2026-09-11).
5. **The geometry states are drawn as implemented** — the dashboard's highlight for hover and
   selection, the editor's overlay on top: face theme/800 at 10% with a 2px edge (others 6%, 1.5px at
   55%), r5 corners, r3.5 midpoints, the box 18px out (12 in plain transform) dashed 5/4 at 70%, r7
   knob on a 26px stem, 9px scale squares (2026-09-11, §193).
6. **Combine is hidden — out of scope; Reset is hidden — Undo and Redo suffice** (2026-09-11).
7. **Map View Preferences carries Snap; Grey out unchanged and Hide POI labels are out of scope; the
   button steps right of an open panel (x 428 = 12 + 400 + 16)** (2026-09-11, §194).
8. **The unsaved guard's third button reads Update**, the footer's verb (2026-09-11, §192).
9. **The stories' 2026-09-11 revision is applied** (§192).
10. **From 2026-09-10:** C is the design; Cancel and Update never hidden — Update greyed until a
    change; one 1px `#c7cad1` field border; Delete confirms in v9's danger tone with Keep focused; a
    delete leaves a notice and has no Undo; several selected edits every applicable property.
11. **Settled earlier:** the Featured star is amber; ⑤'s panel is a component set and ③ instances
    it; no accordions; the panel is flat, no shadow.
12. **The one border stays `foreground/200`; the 3:1 bar is the product's** — logged on ⑦ for the
    product and Kozmos DS (2026-09-12, §198).
13. **Featured has a third look with several selected** — mixed: the on-state amber border with a
    half-filled star, only where the features differed at selection; on → off → mixed like the
    personas; left mixed at Update it writes nothing (2026-09-12).
14. **The FID row is hidden with several selected** (2026-09-12).
15. **Hit areas are a developer note, not a redraw** — the whole persona row is the target; bins and
    chip ✕ carry a 24×24 hit area in code (2026-09-12).
16. **The panel's numbers sit on the product's scales** — type 10 · 11 · 12 · 13 (12 is a product
    size, no token names it), radius 4 · 8 · 16 · full, body top padding 16; the Kozmos Toggle keeps
    its own 30 (2026-09-12).
17. **Closed: the ✕ is consistent; Terminal C stays hidden in US8** (2026-09-12).
18. **The Textarea's error red is the product's Delete red `#b42318`** — danger/500 fails as text
    (2026-09-12).
19. **Tiles are 56×48 and the bar docks beside the panel** — the 24px symbol unchanged; Map Content /
    Edit is 456px; with no panel it sits bottom centre, beside an open panel it docks under the
    Building-Level Selector at (430, 102) (2026-09-12, §199).

## 4 · The Figma file now — what is drawn, what is stated only

- **Drawn:** every story has a flow and at least one screen (the §2 table). Components on ⑤ for
  everything the screens instance, including Featured's mixed look and the hidden FID row with
  several selected. The map bitmaps are v9's, retouched per state.
- **Stated only (⑦ says so):** the cross-floor and cross-building block; cut-out, split and
  straighten across a selection; the guard firing before a selection with unsaved changes changes;
  clearing a search without the map jumping; the paste-meets-unsaved prompt (the same guard); US1's
  "select from the list" and "leave" steps; US6's mark at the moment a snap takes; the 10%–400% clamp
  (a number on ⑤); hit areas (a developer note).
- **Known compromises, written on the file:** the map is illustrative; US8 shows six results because
  Terminal C is hidden (rows inside an instance cannot be reordered — closed as such); v9's placement
  bar ends with Confirm while US3 commits on a left-click; the geometry bar (512px) does not fit
  beside the 400px panel in a 904px map, so the panel screens leave it off and move the selector
  right — resolved 2026-09-12: tiles 56×48, the bar docked under the selector (§199).

## 5 · Open — waiting on Olcay

Nothing. The nine items of the 2026-09-11 handoff were ruled and applied on 2026-09-12 (§198), and
the tenth — the geometry bar beside the floating panel — the same evening (§199): Olcay chose tiles
56×48 over dropping the group gaps or a vertical bar; the bar is 456px and docks under the level
selector beside an open panel, drawn on US7·b. What a next session starts with is whatever Olcay
asks; the open rows on ⑦ are owned by others (§6).

## 6 · Open — for others

- **The stories' author:** v9's placement bar ends with Confirm while US3 commits on a left-click and
  saves at once (⑦, US3 row).
- **The product and Kozmos DS owners:** the input border's 3:1 bar (⑦ `908:18618`): the dashboard's
  own input border is `foreground/100` at 2px (1.27:1); `foreground/500` (4.24:1) would pass, one
  token for every box at once. Also: scopes for coloured text, strokes and icons; a neutral outline
  button; the destructive button's shade; the six custom controls missing from Core (Textarea
  first); v9's overlay is unpublished; ~228 PDS / Pointr bindings still on "Primitive Tokens".
- **The prototype's code (not this workstream's):** `FeaturePanel.tsx` — hide the FID row with
  several selected; draw Featured's mixed look (amber border, half-filled star; `aria-pressed`
  already carries `mixed`); make the whole persona row the click target and give the bins and chip ✕
  a 24×24 hit area; place the band's ✕ where the app's other panels do; snap the panel's type and
  radius to the file's numbers (§3, 16). `GeometryToolbar.tsx` still renders Reset and Combine
  tiles at 64px and lets the bar sit under the open panel — tiles are 56×48 now and the bar docks
  under the level selector beside the panel (§3, 19); `MapSettings.tsx`'s trigger is 44×44 where v9's is 32×32; the app carries the Kozmos-role
  token names from §185 while the file binds the product's tokens.
- **iOS / deploy** (not MAP-595): PR #17's iOS tests fail since 2026-09-08 (four tests in
  `KozmosAdaptiveMapShellTests.swift`); the deploy never rebuilds `@kozmos/react` — see the archived
  2026-09-11 morning handoff §7.

## 7 · How to work here — the traps that cost time

**Figma (`use_figma`, load the `figma-use` skill first):**

- One `setCurrentPageAsync` per call; `page.loadAsync()` for another page's nodes. A node inside an
  INSTANCE on another page is unreachable; a HIDDEN instance's children are invisible to `findAll`.
- A section child's `x`/`y` are section-relative — place by `absoluteTransform`, or append into the
  section and convert. `clone()` of a section child lands on the PAGE; `clone()` of a variant is
  already a COMPONENT and lands inside the set (`createComponentFromNode` on it throws).
- v9's screen frames stack first-on-top (`itemReverseZIndex`) on the root and `body` — insert added
  layers at index 0 there; `mapBody` is normal. `itemReverseZIndex` can only be set on auto-layout
  frames. Anything added to an auto-layout frame needs `layoutPositioning = 'ABSOLUTE'`.
- A bound paint with `opacity` renders opaque on new nodes and inside instances — use raw
  translucent paints; bind only opaque strokes. A library variable imported by key is gone in the next
  call unless bound. Rebind only where the light value is identical (or, by ruling, a hair off).
- **`description` reads back HTML-escaped** (`&#39;`): set descriptions from plain text and compare
  the read-back with an untouched component's; never write a read-back (§198).
- **Instances of a documentation component read its fill by inheritance**, not override: a guard
  that checks each instance's raw value after the component was bound throws. Bind the master, then
  only the instances that really override (`boundVariables` already set = follows).
- **A fixed-size text box switched to auto-height inside a horizontal auto-layout row** can wrap a
  single word (13 → 26 tall): use `WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT` for labels (§198).
- **Count a block by id, not by a y-threshold** — ⑦'s notes block is a heading and six bullets.
- **Layout propagates lazily:** widths read in the same script as a component resize can still show
  the old values (the bar variants read 512 after the tile went to 56); read them in the next call.
- **A ⑦ row's WHY takes two lines (28px) above its rule** — a third line rolls the script back;
  keep the wording to the row and put the numbers in ① or the notes.
- **A guard that throws rolls the whole script back** — write fix scripts as verify-or-throw, and
  read the error's node before retrying.
- The dashboard's `listItem` rows: rename by the `entitiyName` property, never by editing the text
  (the text is bound to the property and rewrites it); `Property 1` is idle | inFocus; rows inside an
  instance cannot be reordered — hide instead.
- Renders: `get_screenshot` never upscales — render a temp frame at the size you want; a REST render
  of an unchanged INSTANCE can be stale after its master changed — render in-app
  (`await node.screenshot({scale})`, which returns the image inline; the tool may drop one image of
  several — render the one you need alone); download with `curl -k` (the sandbox has no CA bundle).
  Images go in through `upload_assets` (single-use URLs, multipart POST) and land as 400×300 frames
  on the desktop app's current page — read the hash, set it as a fill, delete the frame.
- Copying from v9: `osascript -e 'tell application "Figma" to activate'`, then
  `open "figma://file/<key>?node-id=<id>"` selects the node; `computer_batch` ⌘C, `open` this file's
  Workbench, ⌘V (needs the screen-takeover approval — ask Olcay to watch for the card).
- Measure text fit before editing: ③ notes 28px pitch, one line; ⑦ / ① / ⑥ rows 46px (a WHY text may
  be 28 tall above the rule at +30); developer-note bullets 24px pitch, 38 after a 28-tall one; ④ row
  frames grow with their summary. Check overlaps pairwise after moving anything; captions sit 12px
  under screens. Text edits inside styled text: `deleteCharacters` + `insertCharacters` keep the
  surrounding styles; load the fonts of every segment first.
- `search_design_system` is clamped to one query per call; `fetch` is undefined; import by key works
  only for published assets (the Pointr Icon Library is: `settings-04` `4a7bc953…`, `x-close`
  `6c340143…`, `star-01` `ff0eb2f1…`).

**The geometry numbers** come from `apps/mapscale-review/public/map/index.html` (readable source):
`EDIT_INK`, `geomDrawFaces`, `geomDrawHandles`, `orientedBox`, `dominantAngle`, `BOX_PAD`,
`BOX_PAD_ADJUST`, `BOX_STEM`, `HANDLE_R`, `highlightFeatures`. The box engine is ported into
`docs/map-595-assets/retouch-map.py`'s companion script in §193 of the record; the corners of the
bitmap's features are in `geometry.json`.

**Contrast** (on white): `foreground/100` 1.27:1 · `/200` 1.64:1 · `/300` 2.19:1 · `/400` 3.00:1 ·
`/500` 4.24:1 · `/600` 6.10:1; `danger/500 (Base)` `#e43458` 3.9:1 (fails as small text).

**Shell (zsh):** `set -e` does not gate and `cmd | tail || exit 1` tests `tail`; unquoted
`--include=*.ts` aborts; `====` in an `echo` is an equals-expansion; ugrep chokes on long regexes —
use Python. `gh pr edit` can fail on GitHub's classic-Projects deprecation — `gh api -X PATCH
repos/vodoco/kozmos-design-system-/pulls/17 -f title=…` does the edit; read it back. Stage by file,
never `git add -A` (shared checkout); lint-staged runs prettier on commit.

**Memory files with the detail:** `map-595-handoff-pointer`, `figma-use-figma-traps`,
`kozmos-token-roles`, `figma-hidden-instances-read-layerless`, `figma-pages-read-empty-until-loaded`,
`bash-tool-set-e-does-not-gate`, `shell-is-zsh-three-traps`, `kozmos-shared-checkout-stage-by-file`,
`browser-pane-never-paints-shim-raf`, `mapscale-tsc-noemit-checks-nothing`.

Pushed to `origin` up to `f982cf4` on 2026-09-13 ("push the branch"); the reviewer-pass commit waits for the next word. Stage docs by path, never `git add -A`.

## 9 · What's next — the recommendation, 2026-09-13

The file was walked as a reviewer would on 2026-09-13 morning (record §199, its last addendum):
every page's links, overlaps, captions, descriptions and instances checked by script, every page
and every ③ and ⑤ section rendered and read. Three small things were fixed on the way (the
toolbar-states DevNote's stale numbers, US1·c's "after" name, the Contents titles now linking to
their pages). What remains is Olcay's:

1. ~~Push the branch~~ — done 2026-09-13 (`f982cf4`); the reviewer-pass docs commit after it is
   unpushed until his next word.
2. **One check in the file, one click:** ⑤'s "Layer sections & the wayfinding network" section
   `77:144` renders faint — every child at a fifth of its ink — and every measurable cause is
   excluded (opacity, blend, modes, effects, masks, overlaps, the lock, the fill; each child renders
   crisp alone). The one state this API build cannot read is the section's dev status, and a
   section marked Completed is what Figma greys out. Select the section and look at its status in
   the right panel: clear it, or keep it as a deliberate "Part 1, done" signal. Replacing the section
   would clear it but would change the id ④'s "⑤ layer sections" link points at.
3. **His own pass**, now short: Cover → ④ → ③ → ⑤ → ⑦ → ① → ⑥, then the nine Status chips
   (`state=In review` → `Signed off` — the set `1:23` has Draft · In review · Signed off) and the
   Cover's "STATUS IN JIRA — Backlog".
4. **Three messages out**, drafted below to paste; none has been sent.

**To the stories' author.**

> The MAP-595 Figma file is the team's reference now — every story has a flow and at least one
> screen, and ⑦ Handover lists what is drawn and what is stated only. Three things are yours: (1)
> US3 — the dashboard's placement mode ends with a Confirm bar, while the story commits a paste on
> a left-click and saves at once; the file shows the dashboard's bar and flags the difference (⑦,
> US3 row). (2) US6 — whether snap indicators are solid or transparent is still unruled from the
> coming release, and US6 adds ten marks for it to apply to. (3) US5 — "a rectangular frame around
> the selected features": the file draws the frame oriented to the shapes' dominant angle, 18px out
> (12 on the floor plan page); say if you meant an axis-aligned box. Everything else the file
> settles for this phase is in ① Context & decisions with its reason.

**To the developers.**

> The MAP-595 file is the reference for implementation and QA. Start at ④ (one row per story with
> links to where it is drawn), then ⑦ Handover: the coverage table, the keyboard list and the
> developer notes for the panel and the toolbar. Numbers to lift straight from ⑦: the panel's type
> 10 · 11 · 12 · 13, radius 4 · 8 · 16 · full, body padding 16 / 20 / 12 / 16; the one border
> foreground/200 at 1px; the Toolbar tile 56×48 with a 24px symbol; the Map Content / Edit bar
> 456px, bottom centre with no panel and docked under the level selector beside an open panel
> (430, 102 in the map); the preferences button at (16, 796), stepping to x 428 beside the panel;
> the geometry states' faces, handles and transform box (⑤ Transform, with every stroke and
> radius). Behaviour the file states but does not draw is listed per story in ⑦'s third column.

**To the Kozmos DS and product owners.**

> From the MAP-595 file, for the design system and the dashboard: (1) the dashboard's input border
> is foreground/100 at 2px — 1.27:1 on white — and WCAG 1.4.11 asks 3:1 of a control's boundary;
> foreground/500 (4.24:1) would pass with one token for every box at once — a product-wide change,
> logged on ⑦. (2) Kozmos DS - Core scopes colours by role, so coloured text, strokes and icons have
> no scope of their own; a neutral outline button and a destructive button shade are missing. (3)
> Six controls the taxonomy needs are not in Core — Textarea, Opening Hours, Logo, Images, Price
> band, Rating; Textarea first. (4) The dashboard's v9 file publishes only `listItem`; its
> overlays, chrome and controls arrive in other files only by copy-paste. (5) About 228 PDS /
> Pointr bindings still point at the unpublished "Primitive Tokens" collection.

5. **Not this workstream's, still open:** the prototype's code follow-ups (§6), PR #17's failing
   iOS tests, and the deploy that never rebuilds `@kozmos/react`.
