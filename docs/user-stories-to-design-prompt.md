# From a user-stories document to a Kozmos design — the brief to paste

Written 2026-09-21, against `main` at `a02a008`. Every number here was measured that day; §8 says
how to re-measure before trusting one. This file is the long form. §0 is the short form Olcay
pastes into a new chat; the chat then reads this file and does the work.

## 0 · What to paste

> Read `docs/user-stories-to-design-prompt.md` completely and follow it. Then read
> `docs/ds-handoff.md` §0–§2, §5, §8 and §11.
>
> The user stories: <attached | pasted below | path | Drive link>.
> Target: <platform(s) and form factor — e.g. iOS phone; web desktop; both>.
> Figma destination: <team / project — or "the Core Library's project">.
> Base branch: <main | claude/pointr-browse-repairs, if its parts are needed and it is unmerged>.
>
> Run the brief's preconditions first and tell me which hold. Then deliver, in order: the
> normalised stories with their defects and questions; the screen inventory mapped to Kozmos with
> a verdict per part; the flows; the Figma file; the functional prototype; the handoff document.
> Where the design system cannot express something, report it and place a labelled gap — never
> work around it. Ask decisions as short multiple-choice questions, recommended option first, and
> proceed on your recommendation for anything that does not change the screen inventory. No push,
> deploy, merge or publish without my go-ahead. Finish with the closing report the brief describes.

If the chat does not run inside this checkout, prepend §2 case B or C.

## 1 · What this is for

Pointr is putting AI into more of its process. A product meeting produces a user-stories document
written by an AI. That document comes here, and the task is to turn it into what a design and
engineering team can act on, **using the Kozmos design system as it is**:

1. the stories read, normalised and checked (AI-written stories drift, repeat and skip criteria);
2. every screen and state the stories imply, mapped part by part to Kozmos components;
3. the user flows, as diagrams and as a walkable Figma prototype;
4. a Figma design file composed from the Core Library's components;
5. a functional prototype built from `@kozmos/react` with mock data, that the flows drive;
6. a handoff document that carries all of it, plus the gaps the design system has.

The gaps are a deliverable, not a failure. The rule that makes this exercise worth anything is
`docs/ds-handoff.md` §11: **only what the design system exports, its tokens and its roles**. A
workaround hides exactly the evidence being collected. A part that Kozmos cannot express is
recorded, shown as a labelled placeholder, and asked about.

## 2 · Where the design system is

The source of truth is **the repository**, not a package registry. Publishing to npm changes only
how something _outside_ the repository consumes it. Pick the case that applies.

### Case A — inside this checkout (the default)

`/Volumes/4TB Depo/development/K/kozmos-design-system-dev`, branch `main`, remote
`https://github.com/vodoco/kozmos-design-system-.git` (private). The packages resolve as
`workspace:*`; nothing changes here when they are published.

| What                    | Where                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Props and variants      | `docs/figma-library-manifest.json` → `components.items[]` (props, variant values, Code Connect node); regenerate with `pnpm figma:manifest`                                                                                                                                              |
| Tokens and roles        | `packages/tokens/src/tokens-light.json`, `tokens-dark.json`; the roles and the one rule in `docs/style-playbook.md`                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Native                  | `packages/ios` (SwiftUI, package `Kozmos`), `packages/android` (Compose) — the same component names                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Code Connect            | 92 of 98 linked to that file (`figma.linked.config.json`); the native configs under `packages/{ios,android}/`                                                                                                                                                                            |
| What Kozmos still lacks | `docs/ds-scope-2026-09-12.md` §4, `docs/product-ui-coverage-2026-09-14.md` §3–§4, the gap reports listed in `docs/README.md`                                                                                                                                                             |
| Unmerged work           | branch `claude/pointr-browse-repairs` (worktree `/private/tmp/kozmos-browser-compat.uqPMBD`, pushed, nothing merged): the navigation parts, the sheet detents, `CategoryField`, `AISearchButton`, glass and category tokens. Its handoff: `docs/claude-code-handoff-2026-09-21.md` there |

Build before reading anything at runtime: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` then
`pnpm --filter "@kozmos/react..." build` (a fresh worktree has no built packages).

### Case B — another machine, or another repository

```bash
gh repo clone vodoco/kozmos-design-system- kozmos-design-system && cd kozmos-design-system
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm --filter "@kozmos/react..." build
```

The repository is private: `gh auth status` must show an account with access. The Figma library is
not in git — the account running Figma needs access to `Yj4O8p6Y9h2Sa9zJVoAiVY`. Then case A.

### Case C — after the npm publish, from a consumer that is not this repository

As of 2026-09-21 the registry has nothing: `npm view @kozmos/react` is a 404, and `release.yml`
skips publish while `NPM_TOKEN` is unset. When that changes, a consumer installs
`@kozmos/react @kozmos/tokens @kozmos/icons @kozmos/product-contracts` (`@kozmos/vue` is private
by decision §5.15), imports `@kozmos/react/dist/style.css`, wraps the app in `ThemeProvider`, and
reads the READMEs that ship in the packages (the repository stays private, §5.21). In a prototype
under `apps/`, the only line that changes is `"@kozmos/react": "workspace:*"` → the published
version. Everything else in this brief is unchanged, because the docs, the manifest and the Figma
library live in the repository either way.

## 3 · What Olcay provides with the paste

- **The stories** — pasted text, a file (`.md`, `.docx`, `.pdf`: use the matching skill to read it
  whole), or a Google Drive link (the Drive connector). Read all of it before writing anything.
- **Target platform(s) and form factor.** Default if absent: the phone, 402 × 874 CSS px, which
  is the frame the reference prototype uses; ask if the stories name a desktop or a kiosk.
- **The Figma destination** — the team and project for the new file. Default: the Core Library's
  own project.
- **The base branch.** Default `main`. If the stories need parts that exist only on
  `claude/pointr-browse-repairs` and it is unmerged, base the work on it and say so in the report.
- Optionally **reference designs** (Figma file keys, the live prototype
  `https://agentic-search-zeta.vercel.app`). Measure them over the REST API or the DOM; never
  eyeball a screenshot for a number.

## 4 · Preconditions — check first, report in the first message

Run all of these before building anything, and say which held. Items 1 and 2 are stop conditions
for the Figma part only; the rest of the work continues regardless.

1. **Figma write access.** The Figma MCP must list `use_figma`, `create_new_file` and
   `generate_diagram`, and `get_metadata` must answer — this needs the Figma desktop app open with
   its MCP server on. In the session that wrote this brief only the read tools were listed and
   `get_metadata` timed out. If write access is missing, deliver §5.4 as a specification (frames,
   instances, props, reactions, per screen) inside the handoff and say plainly that the Figma file
   was not built.
2. **The Core Library is published** as a team library, so another file can instantiate its
   components: in the new file, `figma.importComponentByKeyAsync` on the Button's key must succeed.
   If it fails, publishing the library is Olcay's one action (Assets → publish) — ask, do not draw
   a Button.
3. **The base branch state.** `git -C <checkout> status --short` and
   `git branch -r --merged origin/main | grep browse-repairs` — is the unmerged branch merged yet?
   Work in a `git worktree` under the scratchpad on a new branch `claude/<slug>-design`; the shared
   checkout stays on `main`.
4. **The build is green.** `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm --filter "@kozmos/react..." build
&& pnpm --filter @kozmos/react typecheck`. A broad, uniform type error is the install, not the
   code (§8 of the handoff).
5. **The stories are read** — count them and echo the count and their titles back, so a missing
   page is caught in the first message.
6. **The Figma REST token** is in `.env` (`FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`, expires 2026-11-24; never print
   it). It reads files for measuring; it cannot list published components (`library_content:read`).
7. **The Pointr taxonomy** is reachable (the Pointr Maps MCP): POI types, sectors and personas the
   stories mention are looked up there, not guessed.

## 5 · The work, in phases

Each phase ends with a short message: what it produced, what it found, what it needs. Findings go
in the handoff document as they are made, not reconstructed at the end.

### 5.1 · Read and normalise the stories

Produce one table, one row per story, that the rest of the work keys on:

| Column     | What                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ID         | `US-01`… in document order, unless the document numbers them                                                                                            |
| Persona    | who; if undefined in the document, name the gap and use the Pointr persona set (`customer`, `visitor`, `staff`, `vip`, `facilityManager`, `contractor`) |
| Goal       | the "I want … so that …" in one line                                                                                                                    |
| Acceptance | each criterion on its own line, rewritten measurable where the source is vague; mark rewritten ones                                                     |
| Platform   | from the story or Olcay's target                                                                                                                        |
| Priority   | as the document says; `unranked` otherwise                                                                                                              |
| Source     | the heading or line in the document                                                                                                                     |

Then the defects, because AI-written stories carry them: duplicates and near-duplicates,
contradictions between stories, criteria that cannot be tested, features a criterion assumes but
no story asks for, undefined personas and terms, anything that names a POI type or persona the
taxonomy does not have. Each defect is a finding with the story IDs it touches.

Questions come out of this phase as **short multiple-choice questions, the recommended option
first**. Proceed on the recommendation for anything that does not change the screen inventory; put
the rest in the report and continue with everything that does not depend on it.

### 5.2 · Map every screen to Kozmos

From the stories, list the **screens and their states**: at least empty, loading, populated and
error for anything that loads; permission-denied and offline where the story implies them;
selected and unselected where there is a list. Name them `US-07 / Search results / Empty` — the
same name is the Figma frame, the prototype route and the flow node.

Then, per screen, **every part mapped to a Kozmos component** with its props and variant, and a
verdict:

| Verdict     | Meaning                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **covered** | the component expresses it as designed                                                                                  |
| **partial** | the component is used and a named axis or value differs — record which (a partial is built, and the deviation recorded) |
| **missing** | no Kozmos equivalent — a gap, shown as a labelled placeholder, never approximated                                       |

Look things up, in this order: `docs/figma-library-manifest.json` (props, variants),
`docs/product-ui-coverage-2026-09-14.md` §3 (30 control groups already given verdicts),
`docs/product-sdk-react-handoff.md` (what a Product / SDK component owns and what the app owns),
`docs/ds-scope-2026-09-12.md` §4 and the gap reports (what is already known missing — do not
rediscover it, cite it). Prefer the Product / SDK set (`POIDetailPanel`, `POIResultList`,
`FloorSelector`, `RoutePreviewPanel`, `AdaptiveMapShell`, `BrowseCategoriesPanel`…) over composing
Core parts into a lookalike.

Every **missing** and every **partial** goes on the gap list with the four things §11 asks for:
the part and the story that needs it; what was tried; the lane it belongs to (Core, Product / SDK,
or an example); the evidence (how often the product draws it, from the coverage scan where it
already counted it, or the count from these stories). Gaps are numbered `GAP-01`… and cited by
number everywhere they appear.

### 5.3 · The flows

One flow per story, merged into one per epic where stories share screens. Nodes are the screen
states of §5.2, by their exact names; edges are user actions or system events, named as the
acceptance criteria name them; diamonds are the branches (no results, permission denied, error,
another floor). Each flow starts at an entry the story names and ends at its goal.

Three forms, which must agree because they share the node names:

1. **Mermaid** in the handoff document — always.
2. **A FigJam board** through `generate_diagram` — when write access holds (load
   `figma:figma-generate-diagram` first). Linked from the handoff.
3. **The Figma prototype's reactions** (§5.4), which make the main path of each flow walkable.

The functional prototype's state machine (§5.5) uses the same edge names, so a flow diagram, the
Figma prototype and the code cannot drift on what a screen does.

### 5.4 · The Figma file

**A new design file, never the Core Library.** Decision §5.8: the library file is painted by the
plugin and is not written by hand or by MCP. Its components are instantiated _from_ it; nothing in
it is touched, and **Rebuild** is never run (§5.4 of the handoff). Load `figma:figma-create-new-file`
before `create_new_file`, and `figma:figma-use` (with `figma:figma-generate-design`) before any
`use_figma` call.

- **Name** `<Project> — user stories <date> (Kozmos)`, in the destination from §3.
- **Pages** `Cover` (the stories table and the legend), `Flows`, one `Screens / <epic>` page per
  epic, `Gaps`, `Handoff`.
- **Frames** named as §5.2 names the screen states, in the target device size, laid out one row
  per story with states left to right. Light and dark only when a story asks: switch the
  collection mode on the frame, never repaint.
- **Every part is an instance** of a Core Library component, imported by key, with its variant
  properties set and its text overridden. Never detach an instance, never draw a lookalike of a
  library component, never override a colour by hand — the instance carries the token bindings.
  Free text uses the library's text styles.
- **A gap is visible**: a dashed frame named `GAP-04 / <part>` with the gap's one-line text, in
  the position the part would take. On the `Gaps` page, the whole list once.
- **The prototype**: a flow starting point on each epic's first screen; `ON_CLICK` reactions —
  `NAVIGATE` between screens, `OVERLAY` for sheets, dialogs and menus, `BACK` where the story
  says so; the transitions the library's motion tokens name, otherwise instant. Read the reactions
  back through `use_figma` after wiring and list them in the handoff; a reaction nobody read back
  does not count as built.
- **Traps that have cost real time** (the memory files in the handoff's §8): a page reads empty
  until `setCurrentPageAsync`; a hidden instance reads layerless; imported variables vanish
  between calls; opacity is lost on bind; `clone()` of a section child lands on the page; text
  boxes set to auto-height wrap; the `⌘Q` rule applies to the plugin, not to this. When a look
  cannot be explained by anything the API can read, ask before changing it.

If a story needs a component the library does not have, the Figma answer is the gap placeholder —
not a new component drawn in the product file. A component change is a design-system PR, proposed
in the handoff, never made in passing.

### 5.5 · The functional prototype

A Vite + React app at `apps/<slug>-prototype`, wired exactly as `apps/mapscale-review/src/main.tsx`
is: `ThemeProvider`, `import "@kozmos/react/dist/style.css"`, `@kozmos/react`, `@kozmos/icons` and
`@kozmos/product-contracts` as `workspace:*`. Functional means: real components, real states,
real transitions, mock data — not a click-through of pictures. The Figma prototype is the
click-through; this is where behaviour lives.

- **Only Kozmos.** Components from `@kozmos/react`; layout from `Stack`, `Grid`, `Container`,
  `Box`; tokens through the components. No Tailwind config of its own that adds one-off classes,
  no raw hex, no hand-rolled markup standing in for a component. A gap renders an `Alert` naming
  its `GAP-nn`, the same way `apps/docs/stories/examples/POIDetailCard.stories.tsx` does.
- **Data** typed with `@kozmos/product-contracts` and, for POIs, types and names from the Pointr
  taxonomy. Fixtures in `src/mock/`, deterministic.
- **Routes** are the screens; one small state machine per flow with the edge names of §5.3, so the
  flow diagram is the code's specification. A route list on the cover route to jump anywhere.
- **Verify in the browser, not by reading the code.** Add the app to `.claude/launch.json`,
  `preview_start` it (it serves the original checkout — if the work is in a worktree, build the
  app and serve `dist`, or the wrong tree is being reviewed), then: `read_console_messages`
  clean; axe on every screen (`@axe-core/playwright` is in the repo); widths 320, 390, 1024 and
  1440 where the target is the web; dark mode; a keyboard walk of each flow. Screenshots to
  `docs/<slug>-assets/`, referenced from the handoff.
- **A flow test** under the app (`scripts/` or `tests/`, Playwright): each flow's edges as steps.
  Break one route on purpose and run it once so it is seen to fail; then fix and run it green. A
  green that never failed proves nothing.
- **Deploy only on "deploy".** The pattern is `apps/mapscale-review/vercel.json`: built locally,
  `dist` uploaded prebuilt, `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`. Until then the URL is the local preview.
- **Storybook examples** are optional and asked for: a composition the stories introduce and the
  system may want to keep becomes `apps/docs/stories/examples/<Name>.stories.tsx` under the same
  rule — only if Olcay says so, since it adds to the system's own gallery.

Gates before calling the prototype done: `pnpm --filter <app> typecheck`, `pnpm --filter <app>
lint`, `pnpm --filter <app> build`, the flow test, and the repo's own — at least
`pnpm components:contract:check`, `pnpm docs:snippets:check` (the handoff's snippets must type-
check) and `pnpm components:classes:check` after a build if any package changed. None should
change, because this brief changes no package; if one does, that is a finding.

### 5.6 · The handoff document

`docs/<slug>-handoff-<date>.md`, indexed in `docs/README.md` under **Current**. Written for two
readers at once: the person who will build this for real, and the person who will change the
prototype or the Figma file themselves — so every number carries the command that measured it, and
every change carries how to redo it by hand.

1. **The one-paragraph answer**: what the stories asked for, what the design system covers, the
   count of covered / partial / missing parts, the one or two gaps that matter most.
2. **The stories** (§5.1's table) and their **defects and questions**.
3. **The screens**: the inventory, each with its Figma frame link, its route, its states.
4. **The flows**: Mermaid, the FigJam link, the reactions read back.
5. **Component usage**: per screen, per part — component, props, variant, verdict, gap number.
6. **The gap list**: `GAP-nn`, the four things, and a **proposed DS change** for each — the lane,
   the size, whether it is a new axis on an existing set or a new component — as PR candidates,
   not as work done here.
7. **Decisions taken** and the alternative not taken, one line each; **open questions** for Olcay
   as multiple choice, recommended first.
8. **For engineering**: per screen the props and contracts, the copy as a table (every string,
   its screen, its state), the states and transitions, the accessibility notes (names, roles,
   focus order, what is announced).
9. **How to run and check it**: the commands, the launch entry, the gates and their outputs.
10. **How to change it yourself**: where each screen, fixture, flow and Figma page lives, and the
    one-line recipe for the common edits.
11. **What was not done and why**, and **the traps met**.
12. **The proof**: the screenshots, the gate outputs, the counts.

## 6 · Rules in force — do not relax them

- **Only the design system.** `docs/ds-handoff.md` §11: what `@kozmos/react` exports, its tokens,
  its roles. A missing part is a labelled gap, reported and asked about; never approximated, never
  deferred silently. A partial is built and its deviation recorded.
- **The Core Library is read-only in this work.** No edits, no Rebuild, no page added to it. The
  design lives in a new file; the system's changes are PR candidates in the handoff.
- **§5 of the handoff is decided — do not reopen it.** The roles, the emotion axis, the brand
  blue, the lanes, the slot rule, the plugin paints the file.
- **The scope is the design and its prototype**, not the product: no SDK integration, no map
  renderer, no API. `MAP-595` and `apps/mapscale-review` stay parked.
- **Measure, never eyeball**: REST, DOM, computed styles, counts — and the command beside every
  number. Verify a finding by hand before reporting it.
- **An adversarial self-audit before "done"**: what was overlooked, mis-implemented, or could
  have been done better; mistakes stated plainly, including your own.
- **A green must name what you added**, and a new check must be seen to fail once.
- **Git**: a worktree under the scratchpad, a new branch, stage by file (never `git add -A` or a
  directory), commits as the natural end of a "proceed"; **no push, PR, merge, deploy or publish
  without a go-ahead in so many words**.
- **Secrets**: never print, copy or commit `.env`, tokens or licence keys; never put personal data
  in a URL.
- **The shell is zsh** and the Bash tool does not gate on `set -e` — gate before pipes.
- **Ask before changing what the API cannot explain.**

## 7 · Definition of done, and the closing report

Done when every item below is true or is named as not done, with the reason:

- [ ] the stories table, the defects and the questions are in the handoff;
- [ ] every screen state is named once and the same name is used in Figma, the flows and the code;
- [ ] every part has a verdict; every partial and missing part is a numbered gap with four things;
- [ ] the flows exist as Mermaid, and as FigJam and reactions where write access held;
- [ ] the Figma file exists with instances only, or §5.4 is a specification and the report says so;
- [ ] the prototype runs, its flow test failed once and passes now, axe and the console are clean,
      the screenshots are in the repo;
- [ ] the gates in §5.5 pass and their output is in the handoff;
- [ ] the handoff document is indexed in `docs/README.md`;
- [ ] the self-audit is written and its findings are fixed or listed.

The closing report, in the chat, in this order and nothing else: what was built, with links (the
Figma file, the FigJam board, the local preview, the handoff path, the branch); what was not built
and why; the gaps that matter most, by number; the questions, multiple choice, recommended first;
the exact commands to run it and to check it; the commit(s) on the branch and the one line to push
them when told. A handoff a new chat can start from is part of done.

## 8 · When this brief is stale

The dated facts: 98 components, 92 Code Connect links, 95 Figma sets, 641 + 641 tokens,
packages at `0.0.1` and unpublished, `claude/pointr-browse-repairs` unmerged, Figma MCP read-only
in the writing session. Re-measure rather than trust: `STATUS.md` (`pnpm exec tsx
scripts/skills/check-completion.ts --check`), `pnpm figma:manifest`, `pnpm figma:verify`,
`npm view @kozmos/react version`, `git branch -r --merged origin/main`. If a number here disagrees
with a measurement, the measurement wins and this file gets the correction in the same commit.
