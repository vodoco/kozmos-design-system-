# Controlled npm releases

Status: implemented locally on `astra/release-safeguards`, based on merged PR #53
(`040f53d`). Not pushed or activated. No release is approved: `release/plan.json`
intentionally contains an empty package list. No credentials, repository settings,
package versions, npm tags or publications were changed.

This replaces the old `workflow_run` publisher. Adding `NPM_TOKEN` must never be
enough to publish. The old workflow on main remains in effect until this change
is reviewed and merged; do not add a token before then.

## What the workflow requires

1. A reviewed, committed `release/plan.json` listing exact public package names,
   versions and the explicit `next` or `latest` npm tag. Only listed packages ship.
   Versions must match workspace manifests; private/unknown/duplicate packages and
   unversioned changesets are rejected. Prerelease versions cannot use `latest`.
2. A successful **main-push** run of `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for that exact SHA
   in this repository. Every job must have succeeded, including web and both native
   jobs. PR runs, skipped jobs, forks and unrelated workflows are not evidence.
3. A manual dispatch **from main**, with the full lowercase 40-character SHA,
   the CI run ID and the exact confirmation `publish <SHA>`. The dispatch commit,
   checkout and candidate SHA must agree. The candidate must still be main HEAD
   at each verification, including at the start of the publish job.
4. Repository variable `NPM_RELEASE_ENABLED=true` and an `npm-release`
   environment carrying an exact `main` branch policy and holding `NPM_TOKEN`
   as an environment secret. There is no approval wait; see "The approval gate
   this plan cannot provide".

Global concurrency serializes releases without cancelling a running publish.
There is no automatic version PR, publication, git tag or GitHub release. Changesets
still manage versions/changelogs through `pnpm changeset` and
`pnpm version-packages` on a reviewed branch. `pnpm release` deliberately exits
with instructions; do not replace it with direct `changeset publish`.

## Exact tested artifacts

The prepare job checks out the requested SHA, builds without npm credentials and
runs the existing package-install test. Only when the type, export, server-render
and React 18/19 README checks pass does it retain the **same tarballs** in an artifact.
The candidate manifest binds package identities, SHA-512 integrity and a digest of
the release plan to the source SHA. CI also exercises this export/readback path in
an isolated fixture; that fixture never edits the real release plan.

The publish job runs in the `npm-release` environment, which is the only place
the npm credential exists; it checks out the same SHA and revalidates live
CI/environment/main evidence. It downloads the exact artifact ID
from its own prepare job, checks hashes and packed manifests, and does not rebuild
or repack. Install scripts are disabled in both jobs' dependency installation;
the npm token is supplied only to the final publishing step. Third-party actions
in the release workflow are pinned to commit SHAs. The GitHub token has read-only
contents/actions permissions and checkout does not persist it.

Before the first write, the publisher checks registry availability, version
collisions and internal dependency availability. Selected dependencies publish
before dependants; omitted internal dependencies must have a published version
satisfying the packed range. Cycles fail for explicit investigation. Publishing
uses the public npm registry, public access, the approved tag and disabled lifecycle
scripts. Private-repository provenance remains disabled, per the existing ruling.

This proves source identity and tested package bytes, **not** reproducible builds,
provenance, visual approval or product/device readiness. CI does not build the exact
artifact later produced by prepare; prepare independently tests what it will ship.

## Owner setup — deliberately not performed by the agent

- Keep `NPM_RELEASE_ENABLED` absent/false until the release checklist is complete.
- Configure `npm-release` with a selected branch rule for `main` (not a wildcard
  or tag). The REST environment response does not expose the administrator-bypass
  setting, so code does not claim to verify it. Administrators and trusted
  workflow authors remain a trust boundary.
- Provision a suitably restricted npm token as the **environment** secret
  `NPM_TOKEN`, never a repository-wide secret, and confirm ownership and publish
  access for the `@kozmos-ds` scope. The token must be granted on the _scope_,
  not on selected packages: before the first release no package exists to
  select. Run `pnpm release:credential:check` before every dispatch: it asks
  GitHub where `NPM_TOKEN` is configured — names and dates only, never a value —
  and fails if it is a repository secret, if the environment does not hold it,
  or if the environment admits any branch but `main`. The workflow cannot check
  this itself, because a job's `GITHUB_TOKEN` has no grantable `secrets`
  permission and a step reading `secrets.NPM_TOKEN` to test it would break the
  rule that exactly one step in the workflow may reference that secret.

### The approval gate this plan cannot provide

This paragraph previously required named reviewers on `npm-release` and told the
owner to stop rather than remove the gate. On 2026-09-23 that instruction was
followed to its conclusion and the answer came back: it cannot be satisfied on
this account. GitHub grants environments, environment secrets and deployment
_branches_ to private repositories on Pro, but wait timers and required
reviewers only to public repositories unless the plan is Enterprise. The REST
API refuses both rules with a billing message and the settings page omits the
section rather than disabling it. The repository is private on Pro.

The owner (Olcay) was shown the evidence and chose, explicitly, to replace the
approval with a fence around the credential rather than make the repository
public or buy Enterprise. What that costs is real and is recorded here: the
dispatch is now the only human act in a release, so whoever can dispatch can
publish unattended. What replaces it: `NPM_TOKEN` moved from a repository secret
that every workflow could read to an environment secret only the publish job, on
`main`, can read, and a `prepare` step that fails if the token is reachable from
outside the environment. Revisit this if the repository becomes public or the
plan changes.

- Protect main and the release workflow/plan from unreviewed edits as part of
  repository governance. Local scripts cannot prevent an administrator or someone
  already holding an npm token from bypassing the workflow outside GitHub.

## Operating a future approved release

1. Close the browser/WebView policy, device/native/product integration,
   accessibility/motion, visual and package-type release blockers. Green CI alone
   does not approve them. In particular, Chromatic's pending UI Tests is not a pass.
2. Version through Changesets, then review the resulting manifests/changelogs and
   exact release plan together. Begin with an explicitly chosen prerelease on `next`;
   the checked-in empty plan is not an implied choice of versions.
3. Merge after CI, wait for successful main-push CI and record its run ID/SHA.
   A documentation-only main commit can have no push CI due to path exclusions;
   do not substitute an older SHA or PR run. Prepare a reviewed release commit that
   actually triggers CI instead.
4. Run `pnpm release:credential:check`, then dispatch `Release Kozmos System`
   from main with those inputs. There is no approval wait on this plan, so the
   review of the plan and of what is about to ship happens **before** the
   dispatch, not between the two jobs: publish follows prepare on its own. If
   main advances mid-run, validation fails: repeat against newly tested main,
   not a moving checkout.
5. Check each package version, integrity and dist-tag. The script verifies these
   after each publish; registry propagation/network trouble stops it for inspection.
   Record the result in release notes. Git tags and GitHub releases need a separate
   explicit action; this workflow has no write permission for them.

## Failure and recovery

npm publication is not transactional. A later package can fail after an earlier one
has published. Do not unpublish, overwrite, retag, bump versions or rerun blindly.
Inspect the workflow artifact and registry first. A retry skips an existing version
only if its integrity and requested dist-tag exactly match. Different bytes or a
changed tag fail before any write. A rebuilt artifact may differ; preserve the original
artifact for recovery (retention is seven days). Rerunning a failed publish job can
reuse its prepare artifact, subject to approval and current-main checks. If the artifact
expired, main moved or registry state differs, stop for a separately reviewed recovery
plan. Never delete a released version to make the tests pass.

## Validation evidence

Four workflow regression tests failed against the original configuration before
the replacement. A later retry-tag regression failed before its preflight correction.
The other safety tests are additional coverage, not claimed as old reproduced bugs.

Measured locally: **35 release tests passed**, all package builds passed, ordinary
React 18/19 tarball checks passed (14 exports, three CommonJS entries and 11 README
samples), and the isolated export smoke test verified all four retained real-package
tarballs. The three known declaration issues remain unchanged. ESLint, frozen-lockfile
installation, diff checks and Actionlint 1.7.12 passed. Actionlint checked workflow
syntax/expressions with its optional shellcheck/pyflakes integrations disabled; those
external tools were not installed. The official Actionlint archive digest was verified
against its GitHub release metadata before running it from a temporary directory.

```sh
pnpm test:release
pnpm --filter './packages/*' build
pnpm packages:install:check
pnpm test:release:packages
pnpm exec eslint scripts/release scripts/check-package-install.mjs
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts
git diff --check
```

The first live dispatch ran on 2026-09-23 and failed at step 3, before any
validation: `pnpm/action-setup@v4` refuses to start when the action input and
`package.json`'s `packageManager` both name a version, and CI never caught it
because CI pins v3, which has no such check. The action input is gone and a
control now asserts the manifest is the only place a pnpm version is declared.
No npm write has been tested; real registry publication still depends on the
token's scope grant, which nothing in this repository can verify. Native/Figma/component behavior is unchanged by this batch.
